In her presence, which is always heightened and\nsexually charged, the male feels transported to a realm of pure pleasure. In a world where\nwomen are often too timid to project such an image, learn to take control of the male libido by\nembodying his fantasy. The Rake page 17\nA woman never quite feels desired and appreciated enough. She wants attention, but a man is\ntoo often distracted and unresponsive. The Rake is a great female fantasy-figure—when he de-\nsires a woman, brief though that moment may be, he will go to the ends of the earth for her. He may be disloyal, dishonest, and amoral, but that only adds to his appeal. Stir a woman's\nrepressed longings by adapting the Rake's mix of danger and pleasure. The Ideal Lover page 29\nMost people have dreams in their youth that get shattered or worn down with age. They find\nthemselves disappointed by people, events, reality, which cannot match their youthful ideals. Ideal Lovers thrive on people's broken dreams, which become lifelong fantasies. You long for ro-\nmance? Adventure? Lofty spiritual communion? The Ideal Lover reflects your fantasy. He or\nshe is an artist in creating the illusion you require. In a world of disenchantment and baseness,\nthere is limitless seductive power in following the path of the Ideal Lover. xi",

We are in-\nstantly attracted to those who are more fluid than we are—those who create their own persona. Dandies excite us because they cannot be categorized, and hint at a freedom we want for our-\nselves. They play with masculinity and femininity; they fashion their own physical image,\nwhich is always startling. Use the power of the Dandy to create an ambiguous, alluring pres-\nence that stirs repressed desires. The Natural page 53\nChildhood is the golden paradise we are always consciously or unconsciously trying to re-create. The Natural embodies the longed-for qualities of childhood—spontaneity, sincerity, unpre-\ntentiousness. In the presence of Naturals, we feel at ease, caught up in their playful spirit,\ntransported back to that golden age. Adopt the pose of the Natural to neutralize people's\ndefensivencss and infect them with helpless delight.

Coquettes are the grand masters of the game, orchestrating a back-and-forth\nmovement between hope and frustration. They bait with the promise of reward—the hope of\nphysical pleasure, happiness, fame by association, power—all of which, however, proves elu-\nsive; yet this only makes their targets pursue them the more. Imitate the alternating heat and\ncoolness of the Coquette and you will keep the seduced at your heels. The Charmer page 79\nCharm is seduction without sex. Charmers are consummate manipulators, masking their clev-\nerness by creating a mood of pleasure and comfort. Their method is simple: They deflect atten-\ntion from themselves and focus it on their target. They understand your spirit, feel your pain,\nadapt to your moods. In the presence of a Charmer you feel better about yourself. Learn to cast\nthe Charmer's spell by aiming at people's primary weaknesses: vanity and self-esteem. The Charismatic page 95\nCharisma is a presence that excites us. It comes from an inner quality—self-confidence, sexual\nenergy, sense of purpose, contentment—that most people lack and want. This quality radiates\noutward, permeating the gestures of Charismatics, making them seem extraordinary and supe-\nrior. They learn to heighten their charisma with a piercing gaze, fiery oratory, an air of mys-\ntery. Create the charismatic illusion by radiating intensity while remaining detached.",

The Star page 119\nDaily life is harsh, and most of us constantly seek escape from it in fantasies and dreams. Stars\nfeed on this weakness; standing out from others through a distinctive and appealing style, they\nmake us want to watch them. At the same time, they are vague and ethereal, keeping their\ndistance, and letting us imagine more than is there. Their dreamlike quality works on our un-\nconscious. Learn to become an object of fascination by projecting the glittering but elusive pres-\nence of the Star.

Anti-seducers\nare the opposite: insecure, self-absorbed, and unable to grasp the psychology of another person,\nthey literally repel Anti-Seducers have no self-awareness, and never realize when they are\npestering, imposing, talking too much.

Study your prey thoroughly, and choose\nonly those who will prove susceptible to your charms. The right victims are those for whom you\ncan fill a void, who see in you something exotic. They are often isolated or unhappy, or can\neasily be made so—for the completely contented person is almost impossible to seduce. The\nperfect victim has some quality that inspires strong emotions in you, making your seductive\nmaneuvers seem more natural and dynamic. The perfect victim allows for the perfect chase. 2 Create a False Sense of Security—Approach Indirectly page 177\nIf you are too direct early on, you risk stirring up a resistance that will never be lowered. At\nfirst there must be nothing of the seducer in your manner. The seduction should begin at an\nangle, indirectly, so that the target only gradually becomes aware of you. Haunt the periphery\nof your target's life—approach through a third party, or seem to cultivate a relatively neutral re-\nlationship, moving gradually from friend to lover. Lull the target into feeling secure, then strike. 3 Send Mixed Signals page 185\nOnce people are aware of your presence, and perhaps vaguely intrigued, you need to stir their\ninterest before it settles on someone else. Most of us are much too obvious—instead, be hard to\nfigure out.",

Most of us are much too obvious—instead, be hard to\nfigure out. Send mixed signals: both tough and tender, both spiritual and earthly, both inno-\ncent and cunning. A mix of qualities suggests depth, which fascinates even as it confuses. An\nelusive, enigmatic aura will make people want to know more, drawing them into your circle. Create such a power by hinting at something contradictory within you. 4 Appear to Be an Object of Desire—Create Triangles page 195\nFew are drawn to the person whom others avoid or neglect; people gather around those who\nhave already attracted interest. To draw your victims closer and make them hungry to possess\nyou, you must create an aura of desirability—of being wanted and courted by many. It will\nbecome a point of vanity for them to be the preferred object of your attention, to win you away\nfrom a crowd of admirers.

Stir within them feelings of discontent, an unhappiness with their circum-\nstances and with themselves. The feelings of inadequacy that you create will give you space to\ninsinuate yourself, to make them see you as the answer to their problems. Pain and anxiety are\nthe proper precursors to pleasure. Learn to manufacture the need that you can fill. 6 Master the Art of Insinuation page 211\nMaking your targets feel dissatisfied and in need of your attention is essential, but if you are\ntoo obvious, they will see through you and grow defensive. There is no known defense, how-\never, against insinuation—the art of planting ideas in people's minds by dropping elusive hints\nthat take root days later, even appearing to them as their own idea. Create a sublanguage—\nbold statements followed by retraction and apology, ambiguous comments, banal talk combined\nwith alluring glances—that enters the target's unconscious to convey your real meaning. Make\neverything suggestive. 7 Enter Their Spirit page 219\nMost people are locked in their own worlds, making them stubborn and hard to persuade.

As the serpent tempted Eve with the promise of forbidden knowledge, you\nmust awaken a desire in your targets that they cannot control. Find that weakness of theirs,\nthat fantasy that has yet to be realized, and hint that you can lead them toward it. The key is\nto keep it vague.

Contents • xv\n10 Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion page 251\nIt is hard to make people listen; they are consumed with their own thoughts and desires, and\nhave little time for yours. The trick to making them listen is to say what they want to hear, to\nfill their ears with whatever is pleasant to them. This is the essence of seductive language. In-\nflame people's emotions with loaded phrases, flatter them, comfort their insecurities, envelop\nthem in sweet words and promises, and not only will they listen to you, they will lose their\nwill to resist you. 11 Pay Attention to Detail page 265\nLofty words of love and grand gestures can be suspicious: Why are you trying so hard to\nplease? The details of a seduction—the subtle gestures, the offhand things you do—are often\nmore charming and revealing. You must learn to distract your victims with a myriad of pleas-\nant little rituals—thoughtful gifts tailored just for them, clothes and adornments designed to\nplease them, gestures that show the time and attention you are paying them.

Familiarity and overexposure will cause this reaction. Remain\nelusive, then. Intrigue your targets by alternating an exciting presence with a cool distance,\nexuberant moments followed by calculated absences. Associate yourself with poetic images and\nobjects, so that when they think of you, they begin to see you through an idealized halo. The\nmore you figure in their minds, the more they will envelop you in seductive fantasies. 13 Disarm Through Strategic Weakness and Vulnerability page 285\nToo much maneuvering on your part may raise suspicion. The best way to cover your tracks is\nto make the other person feel superior and stronger. If you seem to be weak, vulnerable, en-\nthralled by the other person, and unable to control yourself you will make your actions look\nmore natural, less calculated. Physical weakness—tears, bashfulness, paleness—will help cre-\nate the effect. Play the victim, then transform your target's sympathy into love. 14 Confuse Desire and Reality—The Perfect Illusion page 295\nTo compensate for the difficulties in their lives, people spend a lot of their time daydreaming,\nimagining a future full of adventure, success, and romance.

By slowly isolating your victims, you make them more vulnerable\nto your influence. Take them away from their normal milieu, friends, family, home. Give them\nthe sense of being marginalized, in limbo—they are leaving one world behind and entering\nanother.

What good was a power that was so temporary\nand frail? Yet women had no choice but to submit to this condition. There\nwere some, though, whose hunger for power was too great, and who, over\nthe years, through much cleverness and creativity, invented a way of turn-\ning the dynamic around, creating a more lasting and effective form of\npower. These women—among them Bathsheba, from the Old Testament;\nHelen of Troy; the Chinese siren Hsi Shi; and the greatest of them all,\nCleopatra—invented seduction. First they would draw a man in with an al-\nluring appearance, designing their makeup and adornment to fashion the\nimage of a goddess come to life.

Then, in the seventeenth century came a great change:\nmen grew interested in seduction as a way to overcome a young woman's\nresistance to sex. History's first great male seducers—the Duke de Lauzun,\nthe different Spaniards who inspired the Don Juan legend—began to adopt\nthe methods traditionally employed by women. They learned to dazzle\nwith their appearance (often androgynous in nature), to stimulate the\nimagination, to play the coquette. They also added a new, masculine ele-\nment to the game: seductive language, for they had discovered a woman's\nweakness for soft words. These two forms of seduction—the feminine use\nof appearances and the masculine use of language—would often cross\ngender lines: Casanova would dazzle a woman with his clothes; Ninon\nde l'Enclos would charm a man with her words. At the same time that men were developing their version of seduction,\nothers began to adapt the art for social purposes.

Seduction is\na kind of theater in real life, the meeting of illusion and reality. Finally, seducers are completely amoral in their approach to life. It is all\na game, an arena for play. Knowing that the moralists, the crabbed repressed\ntypes who croak about the evils of the seducer, secretly envy their power,\nthey do not concern themselves with other people's opinions. They do not\ndeal in moral judgments—nothing could be less seductive.

Seduction is a form of deception, but people\nwant to be led astray, they yearn to be seduced. If they didn't, seducers\nwould not find so many willing victims. Get rid of any moralizing tenden-\ncies, adopt the seducer's playful philosophy, and you will find the rest of the\nprocess easy and natural. The Art of Seduction is designed to arm you with weapons of persuasion and\ncharm, so that those around you will slowly lose their ability to resist with-\nout knowing how or why it has happened. It is an art of war for delicate\ntimes. Every seduction has two elements that you must analyze and under-\nstand: first, yourself and what is seductive about you; and second, your tar-\nget and the actions that will penetrate their defenses and create surrender. The two sides are equally important.",

The two sides are equally important. If you strategize without paying at-\ntention to the parts of your character that draw people to you, you will be\nseen as a mechanical seducer, slimy and manipulative. If you rely on your\nseductive personality without paying attention to the other person, you will\nmake terrible mistakes and limit your potential. Consequently, The Art of Seduction is divided into two parts. The first\nhalf, \"The Seductive Character,\" describes the nine types of seducer, plus\nthe Anti-Seducer. Studying these types will make you aware of what is\ninherently seductive in your character, the basic building block of any se-\nduction. The second half, \"The Seductive Process,\" includes the twenty-\nfour maneuvers and strategies that will instruct you on how to create a\nspell, break down people's resistance, give movement and force to your\nseduction, and induce surrender in your target. As a kind of bridge be-\ntween the two parts, there is a chapter on the eighteen types of victims of a\nseduction—each of them missing something from their lives, each cradling\nan emptiness you can fill. Knowing what type you are dealing with will\nhelp you put into practice the ideas in both sections. Ignore any part of this\nbook and you will be an incomplete seducer.",

The ideas and strategies in The Art of Seduction are based on the writings\nand historical accounts of the most successful seducers in history. The\nsources include the seducers' own memoirs (by Casanova, Errol Flynn, Na-\ntalie Barney, Marilyn Monroe); biographies (of Cleopatra, Josephine Bona-\nparte, John F. Kennedy, Duke Ellington); handbooks on the subject (most\nnotably Ovid's Art of Love); and fictional accounts of seductions (Choderlos\nde Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons, Søren Kierkegaard's The Seducer's Diary,\nMurasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji). The heroes and heroines of these lit-\nerary works are generally modeled on real-life seducers. The strategies they\nemploy reveal the intimate connection between fiction and seduction, cre-\nating illusion and leading a person along. In putting the book's lessons into\npractice, you will be following in the path of the greatest masters of the art. Finally, the spirit that will make you a consummate seducer is the spirit\nin which you should read this book.

Successful seductions begin\nwith your character, your ability to radiate some quality that attracts people\nand stirs their emotions in a way that is beyond their control. Hypnotized\nby your seductive character, your victims will not notice your subsequent\nmanipulations. It will then be child's play to mislead and seduce them. There are nine seducer types in the world. Each type has a particular\ncharacter trait that comes from deep within and creates a seductive pull. Sirens have an abundance of sexual energy and know how to use it. Rakes\ninsatiably adore the opposite sex, and their desire is infectious. Ideal Lovers\nhave an aesthetic sensibility that they apply to romance. Dandies like to play\nwith their image, creating a striking and androgynous allure. Naturals are\nspontaneous and open. Coquettes are self-sufficient, with a fascinating cool\nat their core. Charmers want and know how to please—they are social crea-\ntures. Charismatics have an unusual confidence in themselves.

The Spectacular Siren\nIn the year 48 B.C., Ptolemy XIV of Egypt managed to depose and exile\nhis sister and wife, Queen Cleopatra.

Later that year, Julius Cae-\nsar came to Alexandria to ensure that despite the local power struggles,\nEgypt would remain loyal to Rome.

A few years\nlater, while Antony was in Syria, Cleopatra invited him to come meet her\nin the Egyptian town of Tarsus.

He flattered the crowd, made them feel they were part of some\ndrama. Everything was vague and suggestive. The issue of the day was the ownership of the city of Fiume, just across\nthe border in neighboring Yugoslavia. Many Italians believed that Italy's re-\nward for siding with the Allies in the recent war should be the annexation\nof Fiume. D'Annunzio championed this cause, and because of his status as\na war hero the army was ready to side with him, although the government\nopposed any action. In September of 1919, with soldiers rallying around\nhim, D'Annunzio led his infamous march on Fiume.

(Don Juan ends by go-\ning to hell, and the word \"rake\" comes from \"rakehell,\" a man who rakes\nthe coals of hell; the devilish component, clearly, is an important part of\nthe fantasy.) Always remember: if you are to play the Rake, you must con-\nvey a sense of risk and darkness, suggesting to your victim that she is partici-\npating in something rare and thrilling—a chance to play out her own rakish\ndesires. To play the Rake, the most obvious requirement is the ability to let\nyourself go, to draw a woman into the kind of purely sensual moment in\nwhich past and future lose meaning. You must be able to abandon yourself\nto the moment.",

(When the Rake Valmont—a character modeled after the\nDuke de Richelieu—in Laclos' eighteenth-century novel Dangerous Liaisons\nwrites letters that are obviously calculated to have a certain effect on his\nchosen victim, Madame de Tourvel, she sees right through them; but when\nhis letters really do burn with passion, she begins to relent.) An added\nbenefit of this quality is that it makes you seem unable to control yourself, a\ndisplay of weakness that a woman enjoys. By abandoning yourself to the\nseduced, you make them feel that you exist for them alone—a feeling re-\nflecting a truth, though a temporary one. Of the hundreds of women that\nPablo Picasso, consummate rake, seduced over the years, most of them had\nthe feeling that they were the only one he truly loved. The Rake never worries about a woman's resistance to him, or for that\nmatter about any other obstacle in his path—a husband, a physical barrier. Resistance is only the spur to his desire, enflaming him all the more. When\nPicasso was seducing Françoise Gilot, in fact, he begged her to resist; he\nneeded resistance to add to the thrill. In any case, an obstacle in your way\ngives you the opportunity to prove yourself, and the creativity you bring to\nmatters of love.",

Never worry about going too far: the Rake's essence is that he\ngoes further than anyone else. When the Earl of Rochester, seventeenth-century England's most no-\ntorious Rake and poet, abducted Elizabeth Malet, one of the most sought-\nafter young ladies of the court, he was duly punished. But lo and behold, a\nfew years later young Elizabeth, though wooed by the most eligible bache-\nlors in the country, chose Rochester to be her husband. In demonstrating\nhis audacious desire, he made himself stand out from the crowd. Related to the Rake's extremism is the sense of danger, taboo, perhaps\neven the hint of cruelty about him. This was the appeal of another poet\nRake, one of the greatest in history: Lord Byron. Byron disliked any kind\nof convention, and happily played this up. When he had an affair with his\nhalf sister, who bore a child by him, he made sure that all of England knew\nabout it. He could be uncommonly cruel, as he was to his wife.

In the old days, a Rake was often an aristocrat, and no matter\nhow many people he offended or even killed, in the end he would go un-\npunished.

This might seem to suggest that you should step lightly\naround husbands and boyfriends, especially early on in your career. But the\ncharm of the Rake is that such dangers don't matter to them. You cannot\nbe a Rake by being fearful and prudent; the occasional pummeling is part\nof the game. Later on, in any case, at the height of Elvis's fame, no husband\nwould dare touch him. The greater danger for the Rake comes not from the violently offended\nhusband but from those insecure men who feel threatened by the Don Juan\nfigure. Although they will not admit it, they envy the Rake's life of plea-\nsure, and like everyone envious, they will attack in hidden ways, often\nmasking their persecutions as morality. The Rake may find his career en-\ndangered by such men (or by the occasional woman who is equally inse-\ncure, and who feels hurt because the Rake does not want her). There is\nlittle the Rake can do to avoid envy; if everyone was as successful in seduc-\ntion, society would not function. So accept envy as a badge of honor. Don't be naive, be aware.

In her boudoir she pointed\nout a wing of the house, a chapel, just outside her window. Sure enough, as\nif he had read her mind, Casanova came to the chapel the next day to at-\ntend Mass, and seeing her at the theater that evening he mentioned to her\nthat he had noticed a door there that must lead to her bedroom.

Jeanne learned to sing, to play the clavichord, to ride with uncommon skill,\nto act and dance; she was schooled in literature and history as if she were a\nboy. The playwright Crébillon instructed her in the art of conversation.During the early 1970s,\nagainst a turbulent political\nbackdrop that included the\nfiasco of American\ninvolvement in the\nVietnam War and the\ndownfall of President\nRichard Nixon's\npresidency in the Watergate\nscandal, a \"me generation\"\nsprang to prominence—and\n[Andy] Warhol was there\nto hold up its mirror.

Valentino understood this perfectly. His off-screen\nlife corresponded to his movie image: he wore bracelets on his arm, dressed\nimpeccably, and reportedly was cruel to his wife, and hit her. (His adoring\npublic carefully ignored his two failed marriages and his apparently nonex-\nistent sex life.) When he suddenly died—in New York in August 1926, at\nthe age of thirty-one, from complications after surgery for an ulcer—the\nresponse was unprecedented: more than 100,000 people filed by his coffin,\nmany female mourners became hysterical, and the whole nation was spell-\nbound. Nothing like this had happened before for a mere actor. There is a film of Valentino's, Monsieur Beaucaire, in which he plays a total\nfop, a much more effeminate role than he normally played, and without his\nusual hint of dangerousness. The film was a flop. Women did not respond\nto Valentino as a swish. They were thrilled by the ambiguity of a man who\nshared many of their own feminine traits, yet remained a man.",

He wooed as a woman would woo if she were a man—slowly,\nattentively, paying attention to details, setting a rhythm instead of hurrying\nto a conclusion. Yet when the time came for boldness and conquest, his\ntiming was impeccable, overwhelming his victim and giving her no chance\nto protest.

Valentino remains an enigma to this day. His private life and his charac-\nter are wrapped in mystery; his image continues to seduce as it did during\nhis lifetime. He served as the model for Elvis Presley, who was obsessed\nwith this star of the silents, and also for the modern male dandy who plays\nwith gender but retains an edge of danger and cruelty.

The opposite sex is a strange country we can never know, and this ex-\ncites us, creates the proper sexual tension. But it is also a source of annoy-\nance and frustration. Men do not understand how women think, and vice\nversa; each tries to make the other act more like a member of their own\nsex. Dandies may never try to please, but in this one area they have a pleas-\ning effect: by adopting psychological traits of the opposite sex, they appeal\nto our inherent narcissism.

Men wanted more from her than just to be her friend or companion,\nas if she were another man; charmed by her empathy for male psychology,\nthey fell in love with her. This kind of mental transvestism—the ability to\nenter the spirit of the opposite sex, adapt to their way of thinking, mirror\ntheir tastes and attitudes—can be a key element in seduction. It is a way of\nmesmerizing your victim. According to Freud, the human libido is essentially bisexual; most peo-\nple are in some way attracted to people of their own sex, but social con-\nstraints (varying with culture and historical period) repress these impulses. The Dandy represents a release from such constraints. In several of Shake-\nspeare's plays, a young girl (back then, the female roles in the theater were\nactually played by male actors) has to go into disguise and dresses up as a\nboy, eliciting all kinds of sexual interest from men, who later are delighted\nto find out that the boy is actually a girl.

Elvis Presley had feminine features (the face, the\nhips), wore frilly pink shirts and eye makeup, and attracted the attention of\nwomen early on. The filmmaker Kenneth Anger said of Mick Jagger that it\nwas \"a bisexual charm which constituted an important part of the attrac-\ntion he had over young girls . . . and which acted upon their unconscious.\" In Western culture for centuries, in fact, feminine beauty has been far more The Dandy • 51\nfetishized than male beauty, so it is understandable that a feminine-looking\nface like that of Montgomery Clift would have more seductive power than\nthat of John Wayne.

Al-\nthough this activity is highly charged and seductive, it is also dangerous,\nsince it touches on a source of great anxiety and insecurity. The greater\ndangers will often come from your own sex. Valentino had immense appeal\nfor women, but men hated him. He was constantly dogged with accusa-\ntions of being perversely unmasculine, and this caused him great pain. Sa-\nlomé was equally disliked by women; Nietzsche's sister, and perhaps his\nclosest friend, considered her an evil witch, and led a virulent campaign\nagainst her in the press long after the philosopher's death. There is little to\nbe done in the face of resentment like this. Some Dandies try to fight the\nimage they themselves have created, but this is unwise: to prove his mas-\nculinity, Valentino would engage in a boxing match, anything to prove his\nmasculinity. He wound up looking only desperate. Better to accept society's\noccasional gibes with grace and insolence. After all, the Dandies' charm is\nthat they don't really care what people think of them.",

That is how Andy\nWarhol played the game: when people tired of his antics or some scandal\nerupted, instead of trying to defend himself he would simply move on to\nsome new image—decadent bohemian, high-society portraitist, etc.—as if\nto say, with a hint of disdain, that the problem lay not with him but with\nother people's attention span. Another danger for the Dandy is the fact that insolence has its limits. Beau Brummel prided himself on two things: his trimness of figure and his\nacerbic wit. His main social patron was the Prince of Wales, who, in later\nyears, grew plump. One night at dinner, the prince rang for the butler, and\nBrummel snidely remarked, \"Do ring, Big Ben.\" The prince did not ap-\npreciate the joke, had Brummel shown out, and never spoke to him again. Without royal patronage, Brummel fell into poverty and madness. Even a Dandy, then, must measure out his impudence. A true Dandy\nknows the difference between a theatrically staged teasing of the powerful\nand a remark that will truly hurt, offend, or insult.

As a child growing up in England, Charlie Chaplin spent years in dire\npoverty, particularly after his mother was committed to an asylum. In his\nearly teens, forced to work to live, he landed a job in vaudeville, eventually\ngaining some success as a comedian. But Chaplin was wildly ambitious, and\nso, in 1910, when he was only nineteen, he emigrated to the United States,\nhoping to break into the film business. Making his way to Hollywood, he\nfound occasional bit parts, but success seemed elusive: the competition was\nfierce, and although Chaplin had a repertoire of gags that he had learned in\nvaudeville, he did not particularly excel at physical humor, a critical part of\nsilent comedy. He was not a gymnast like Buster Keaton. In 1914, Chaplin managed to get the lead in a film short called Making\na Living. His role was that of a con artist.

A review in a trade magazine\nread, \"The clever player who takes the role of a nervy and very nifty\nsharper in this picture is a comedian of the first water, who acts like one of\nNature's own naturals.\" And audiences also responded—the film made\nmoney. What seemed to touch a nerve in Making a Living, setting Chaplin apart\nfrom the horde of other comedians working in silent film, was the almost\npathetic naiveté of the character he played. Sensing he was onto something,\nChaplin shaped the role further in subsequent movies, rendering him more\nand more naive.

According to Freud (who\nwas speaking from experience, since he was his mother's darling), spoiled\nchildren have a confidence that stays with them all their lives.

Since their spirit and natural energy were\nnever tamed by a disciplining parent, as adults they are adventurous and\nbold, and often impish or brazen. The lesson is simple: it may be too late to be spoiled by a parent, but it\nis never too late to make other people spoil you. It is all in your attitude.

In fact seduction depends on mimesis, on the\nconscious creation of a mood or feeling that is then reproduced by the\nother person. But hesitation and awkwardness are also contagious, and\nare deadly to seduction. If in a key moment you seem indecisive or self-\nconscious, the other person will sense that you are thinking of yourself, in-\nstead of being overwhelmed by his or her charms. The spell will be broken. As an undefensive lover, though, you produce the opposite effect: your vic-\ntim might be hesitant or worried, but confronted with someone so sure and\nnatural, he or she will be caught up in the mood.

Warhol began this process in his artwork, which changed dramatically\nin the early 1960s.

They drew\nyou in by their immediacy, their visual power, their coldness. Having trans-\nformed his art, Warhol also transformed himself: like his paintings, he be-\ncame pure surface.

But the real essence of Coquettes is in fact their ability to\ntrap people emotionally, and to keep their victims in their clutches long af-\nter that first titillation of desire. This is the skill that puts them in the ranks\nof the most effective seducers. Their success may seem somewhat odd,\nsince they are essentially cold and distant creatures; should you ever get to\nknow one well, you will sense his or her inner core of detachment and self-\nlove.

To understand the peculiar power of the Coquette, you must first\nunderstand a critical property of love and desire: the more obviously you\npursue a person, the more likely you are to chase them away. Too much at-\ntention can be interesting for a while, but it soon grows cloying and finally\nbecomes claustrophobic and frightening. It signals weakness and neediness,\nan unseductive combination. How often we make this mistake, thinking\nour persistent presence will reassure. But Coquettes have an inherent un-\nderstanding of this particular dynamic. Masters of selective withdrawal,\nthey hint at coldness, absenting themselves at times to keep their victim off\nbalance, surprised, intrigued. Their withdrawals make them mysterious,\nand we build them up in our imaginations. (Familiarity, on the other hand,\nundermines what we have built.)

Re-\nmember: the essence of the Coquette lies not in the tease and temptation\nbut in the subsequent step back, the emotional withdrawal. That is the key\nto enslaving desire. To adopt the power of the Coquette, you must understand one other\nquality: narcissism. Sigmund Freud characterized the \"narcissistic woman\"\n(most often obsessed with her appearance) as the type with the greatest ef-\nfect on men. As children, he explains, we pass through a narcissistic phase\nthat is immensely pleasurable. Happily self-contained and self-involved, we\nhave little psychic need of other people. Then, slowly, we are socialized and\ntaught to pay attention to others—but we secretly yearn for those blissful\nearly days. The narcissistic woman reminds a man of that period, and makes\nhim envious. Perhaps contact with her will restore that feeling of self-\ninvolvement. A man is also challenged by the female Coquette's independence—he\nwants to be the one to make her dependent, to burst her bubble.

For the narcissistic woman is\nnot emotionally needy; she is self-sufficient. And this is surprisingly seduc-\ntive. Self-esteem is critical in seduction. (Your attitude toward yourself is\nread by the other person in subtle and unconscious ways.) Low self-esteem\nrepels, confidence and self-sufficiency attract. The less you seem to need\nother people, the more likely others will be drawn to you. Understand the\nimportance of this in all relationships and you will find your neediness\neasier to suppress. But do not confuse self-absorption with seductive narcis-\nsism. Talking endlessly about yourself is eminently anti-seductive, revealing\nnot self-sufficiency but insecurity. The Coquette is traditionally thought of as female, and certainly the\nstrategy was for centuries one of the few weapons women had to engage\nand enslave a man's desire. One ploy of the Coquette is the withdrawal of\nsexual favors, and we see women using this trick throughout history: the\ngreat seventeenth-century French courtesan Ninon de l'Enclos was desired\nby all the preeminent men of France, but only attained real power when\nshe made it clear that she would no longer sleep with a man as part of her\nduty.",

The Charmer's solution is to fulfill the aspects of\nsexuality that are so alluring and addictive—the focused attention, the\nboosted self-esteem, the pleasurable wooing, the understanding (real or\nillusory)—but subtract the sex itself. It's not that the Charmer represses\nor discourages sexuality; lurking beneath the surface of any attempt at\ncharm is a sexual tease, a possibility. Charm cannot exist without a hint of\nsexual tension. It cannot be maintained, however, unless sex is kept at bay\nor in the background. The word \"charm\" comes from the Latin carmen, a song, but also an in-\ncantation tied to the casting of a magical spell.

And the secret to capturing people's\nattention, while lowering their powers of reason, is to strike at the things\nthey have the least control over: their ego, their vanity, and their self-\nesteem. As Benjamin Disraeli said, \"Talk to a man about himself and\nhe will listen for hours.\" The strategy can never be obvious; subtlety is the\nCharmer's great skill. If the target is to be kept from seeing through\nthe Charmer's efforts, and from growing suspicious, maybe even tiring of the\nattention, a light touch is essential. The Charmer is like a beam of light that\ndoesn't play directly on a target but throws a pleasantly diffused glow over it. Charm can be applied to a group as well as to an individual: a leader\ncan charm the public. The dynamic is similar. The following are the laws of\ncharm, culled from the stories of the most successful charmers in history. Make your target the center of attention.

The extent to which this side of Victoria had been repressed merely\nrevealed the strength of the feelings he would stir once he melted her\nreserve. Disraeli's approach was to appeal to two aspects of Victoria's personality\nthat other people had squashed: her confidence and her sexuality. He was a\nmaster at flattering a person's ego. As one English princess remarked,\n\"When I left the dining room after sitting next to Mr. Gladstone, I thought\nhe was the cleverest man in England. But after sitting next to Mr. Disraeli, I\nthought I was the cleverest woman in England.\" Disraeli worked his magic\nwith a delicate touch, insinuating an atmosphere of amusement and relax-\nation, particularly in relation to politics.

Our personalities are often molded by how we are treated: if a parent or\nspouse is defensive or argumentative in dealing with us, we tend to respond\nthe same way. Never mistake people's exterior characteristics for reality, for\nthe character they show on the surface may be merely a reflection of the\npeople with whom they have been most in contact, or a front disguising\nits own opposite. A gruff exterior may hide a person dying for warmth; a\nrepressed, sober-looking type may actually be struggling to conceal uncon-\ntrollable emotions.

In December of 1936, Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Chinese Nation-\nalists, was captured by a group of his own soldiers who were angry with his\npolicies: instead of fighting the Japanese, who had just invaded China, he\nwas continuing his civil war against the Communist armies of Mao Ze-\ndong. The soldiers saw no threat in Mao—Chiang had almost annhilated\nthe Communists. In fact, they believed he should join forces with Mao\nagainst the common enemy—it was the only patriotic thing to do.",

The sol-\ndiers thought by capturing him they could compel Chiang to change his\nmind, but he was a stubborn man. Since Chiang was the main impediment\nto a unified war against the Japanese, the soldiers contemplated having him\nexecuted, or turned over to the Communists. As Chiang lay in prison, he could only imagine the worst. Several days\nlater he received a visit from Zhou Enlai—a former friend and now a lead-\ning Communist. Politely and respectfully, Zhou argued for a united front:\nCommunists and Nationalists against the Japanese. Chiang could not begin\nto hear such talk; he hated the Communists with a passion, and became\nhopelessly emotional. To sign an agreement with the Communists in these\ncircumstances, he yelled, would be humiliating, and would lose me all\nhonor among my own army. It's out of the question. Kill me if you must. Zhou listened, smiled, said barely a word. As Chiang's rant ended he\ntold the Nationalist general that a concern for honor was something he\nunderstood, but that the honorable thing for them to do was actually to\nforget their differences and fight the invader. Chiang could lead both\narmies. Finally, Zhou said that under no circumstances would he allow his\nfellow Communists, or anyone for that matter, to execute such a great man\nas Chiang Kai-shek.",

Apparently Zhou had executed this policy on his own,\nfor when word of it reached the other Communist leaders, they were out-\nraged: Zhou should have forced Chiang to fight the Japanese, or else should\nhave ordered his execution—to release him without concessions was the\nheight of pusillanimity, and Zhou would pay.

They must live out their ideals without caring about the consequences. The saintly effect bestows charisma. Saintliness goes far beyond religion: politicians as disparate as George\nWashington and Lenin won saintly reputations by living simply, despite\ntheir power—by matching their political values to their personal lives. Both\nmen were virtually deified after they died. Albert Einstein too had a saintly\naura—childlike, unwilling to compromise, lost in his own world. The key\nis that you must already have some deeply held values; that part cannot be\nfaked, at least not without risking accusations of charlatanry that will de-\nstroy your charisma in the long run. The next step is to show, as simply and\nsubtly as possible, that you live what you believe.

A Charismatic relies on the power of words. The reason is\nsimple: words are the quickest way to create emotional disturbance. They\ncan uplift, elevate, stir anger, without referring to anything real. During the\nSpanish Civil War, Dolores Gómez Ibarruri, known as La Pasionaria, gave\npro-Communist speeches that were so emotionally powerful as to deter-\nmine several key moments in the war. To bring off this kind of eloquence,\nit helps if the speaker is as emotional, as caught up in words, as the audi-\nence is.

Theatricality. A Charismatic is larger than life, has extra presence. Actors\nhave studied this kind of presence for centuries; they know how to stand\non a crowded stage and command attention.

At the\nhigh school prom, he was the only boy who didn't dance. He seemed lost\nin a private world, in love with the guitar he took everywhere. At the Ellis\nAuditorium, at the end of an evening of gospel music or wrestling, the\nconcessions manager would often find Elvis onstage, miming a perfor-\nmance and taking bows before an imaginary audience. Asked to leave, he\nwould quietly walk away. He was a very polite young man. In 1953, just out of high school, Elvis recorded his first song, in a local\nstudio. The record was a test, a chance for him to hear his own voice. A\nyear later the owner of the studio, Sam Phillips, called him in to record two\nblues songs with a couple of professional musicians. They worked for\nhours, but nothing seemed to click; Elvis was nervous and inhibited. Then,\nnear the end of the evening, giddy with exhaustion, he suddenly let loose\nand started to jump around like a child, in a moment of complete self-\nabandon. The other musicians joined in, the song getting wilder and\nwilder.",

He was as nervous as he had been at the recording session,\nand could only stutter when he had to speak; but once he broke into song,\nthe words came out. The crowd responded excitedly, rising to peaks at\ncertain moments. Elvis couldn't figure out why. \"I went over to the man-\nager after the song,\" he later said, \"and I asked him what was making the\ncrowd go nuts. He told me, 'I'm not really sure, but I think that every\ntime you wiggle your left leg, they start to scream. Whatever it is, just\ndon't stop.' A single Elvis recorded in 1954 became a hit. Soon he was in demand. Going onstage filled him with anxiety and emotion, so much so that he\nbecame a different person, as if possessed. \"I've talked to some singers\nand they get a little nervous, but they say their nerves kind of settle down\nafter they get into it.

Within a year he had\nbecome the hottest musician in America. His concerts were exercises in\nmass hysteria. Elvis Presley had a dark side, a secret life. (Some have attributed it to the\ndeath, at birth, of his twin brother.) This dark side he deeply repressed as a\nyoung man; it included all kinds of fantasies which he could only give in to\nwhen he was alone, although his unconventional clothing may also have\nbeen a symptom of it.

If you have the ability to rouse those desires, the\ncrowd will see you as having charisma. The key is learning to access your\nown unconscious, as Elvis did when he let go.

Your unin-\nhibitedness will invite other people to open up, sparking a chain reaction:\ntheir excitement in turn will animate you still more.

In March of 1917, the Russian parliament forced the coun-\ntry's ruler, Czar Nicholas, to abdicate and established a provisional govern-\nment. Russia was in rums. Its participation in World War I had been a\ndisaster; famine was spreading widely, the vast countryside was riven by\nlooting and lynch law, and soldiers were deserting from the army en masse. Politically the country was bitterly divided; the main factions were the\nright, the social democrats, and the left-wing revolutionaries, and each of\nthese groups was itself afflicted by dissension. Into this chaos came the forty-seven-year-old Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. A\nMarxist revolutionary, the leader of the Bolshevik Communist party, he\nhad suffered a twelve-year exile in Europe until, recognizing the chaos\novercoming Russia as the chance he had long been waiting for, he had hur-\nried back home.

He was taken to England, where\nhis education continued, and everywhere he went he was pampered and\nrevered. His air of simplicity and contentment could not help but impress. Soon Krishnamurti began to have visions. In 1922 he declared, \"I have\ndrunk at the fountain of Joy and eternal Beauty. I am God-intoxicated.\" Over the next few years he had psychic experiences that the theosophists\ninterpreted as visits from the World Teacher.

The two exceptions to this are childhood and those mo-\nments when we are in love. In both cases, our emotions are more engaged,\nmore open and active. And we equate feeling emotional with feeling more\nalive. A public figure who can affect people's emotions, who can make\nthem feel communal sadness, joy, or hope, has a similar effect. An appeal to\nthe emotions is far more powerful than an appeal to reason. Eva Perón knew this power early on, as a radio actress.

Of\nthe hundreds of struggling young actresses who showed up, most would do\nanything to get the casting director's attention, including exposing them-\nselves. There was one young woman in the line, however, who was simply\ndressed, and performed none of the other girls' desperate antics. Yet she\nstood out anyway. The girl carried a puppy on a leash, and had draped an elegant necklace\naround the puppy's neck. The casting director noticed her immediately. He\nwatched her as she stood in line, calmly holding the dog in her arms and\nkeeping to herself. When she smoked a cigarette, her gestures were slow\nand suggestive. He was fascinated by her legs and face, the sinuous way she\nmoved, the hint of coldness in her eyes. By the time she had come to the\nfront, he had already cast her. Her name was Marlene Dietrich.

Others besides von Sternberg became obsessed with her. A man\ndying of cancer, Count Sascha Kolowrat, had one last wish: to see Mar-\nlene's legs in person. Dietrich obliged, visiting him in the hospital and lift-\ning up her skirt; he sighed and said \"Thank you. Now I can die happy.\" Soon Paramount Studios brought Dietrich to Hollywood, where everyone\nwas quickly talking about her. At a party, all eyes would turn toward her\nwhen she came into the room. She would be escorted by the most hand-\nsome men in Hollywood, and would be wearing an outfit both beautiful\nand unusual—gold-lame pajamas, a sailor suit with a yachting cap. The\nnext day the look would be copied by women all over town; next it would\nspread to magazines, and a whole new trend would start. The real object of fascination, however, was unquestionably Dietrich's\nface. What had enthralled von Sternberg was her blankness—with a simple\nlighting trick he could make that face do whatever he wanted. Dietrich\neventually stopped working with von Sternberg, but never forgot what he\nhad taught her.

Fearing a burglary, he got out of his car,\ncrept up the stairs, and peeked through the crack in the door: it was Diet-\nrich taking pictures of herself in the mirror, studying her face from every\nangle. Marlene Dietrich had a distance from her own self: she could study her\nface, her legs, her body, as if she were someone else. This gave her the\nability to mold her look, transforming her appearance for effect. She could\npose in just the way that would most excite a man, her blankness letting\nhim see her according to his fantasy, whether of sadism, voluptuousness, or\ndanger. And every man who met her, or who watched her on screen, fan-\ntasized endlessly about her. The effect worked on women as well; in the\nwords of one writer, she projected \"sex without gender.\" But this self-\ndistance gave her a certain coldness, whether on film or in person. She was\nlike a beautiful object, something to fetishize and admire the way we ad-\nmire a work of art.

We have grown\nincreasingly cynical. Try to persuade a person by appealing to their con-\nsciousness, by saying outright what you want, by showing all your cards, and\nwhat hope do you have? You are just one more irritation to be tuned out. To avoid this fate you must learn the art of insinuation, of reaching the\nunconscious. The most eloquent expression of the unconscious is the\ndream, which is intricately connected to myth; waking from a dream, we\nare often haunted by its images and ambiguous messages. Dreams obsess us\nbecause they mix the real and the unreal. They are filled with real charac-\nters, and often deal with real situations, yet they are delightfully irrational,\npushing realities to the extremes of delirium. If everything in a dream were\nrealistic, it would have no power over us; if everything were unreal, we\nwould feel less involved in its pleasures and fears.

We sometimes experience the uncanny in waking life—in a déjà vu, a\nmiraculous coincidence, a weird event that recalls a childhood experience. People can have a similar effect. The gestures, the words, the very being of\nmen like Kennedy or Andy Warhol, for example, evoke both the real and\nthe unreal: we may not realize it (and how could we, really), but they are\nlike dream figures to us. They have qualities that anchor them in reality—\nsincerity, playfulness, sensuality—but at the same time their aloofness, their\nsuperiority, their almost surreal quality makes them seem like something\nout of a movie. These types have a haunting, obsessive effect on people. Whether in\npublic or in private, they seduce us, making us want to possess them both\nphysically and psychologically.

The close-up seems to reveal something not\nso much about the character they are playing but about themselves. We\nglimpse something of Greta Garbo herself when we look so closely into\nher face. Never forget this while fashioning yourself as a Star. First, you\nmust have such a large presence that you can fill your target's mind the way\na close-up fills the screen. You must have a style or presence that makes you\nstand out from everyone else. Be vague and dreamlike, yet not distant or\nabsent—you don't want people to be unable to focus on or remember you. They have to be seeing you in their minds when you're not there. Second, cultivate a blank, mysterious face, the center that radiates Star-\nness. This allows people to read into you whatever they want to, imagining\nthey can see your character, even your soul. Instead of signaling moods and\nemotions, instead of emoting or overemoting, the Star draws in interpreta-\ntions. That is the obsessive power in the face of Garbo or Dietrich, or even\nof Kennedy, who molded his expressions on James Dean's.

He\nwould suddenly appear in town, no one knew from where; he spoke many\nlanguages, but his accent belonged to no single country. Nor was it clear\nhow old he was—not young, clearly, but his face had a healthy glow. The\ncount only went out at night. He always wore black, and also spectacular\njewels. Arriving at the court of Louis XV, he was an instant sensation; he\nreeked wealth, but no one knew its source. He made the king and Madame\nde Pompadour believe he had fantastic powers, including even the ability to\nturn base matter into gold (the gift of the Philosopher's Stone), but he\nnever made any great claims for himself; it was all insinuation. He never\nsaid yes or no, only perhaps. He would sit down for dinner but was never\nseen eating. He once gave Madame de Pompadour a gift of candies in a\nbox that changed color and aspect depending on how she held it; this\nentrancing object, she said, reminded her of the count himself.

A Star must stand out, and this may involve a certain dramatic flair, of\nthe kind that Dietrich revealed in her appearances at parties. Sometimes,\nthough, a more haunting, dreamlike effect can be created by subtle touches:\nthe way you smoke a cigarette, a vocal inflection, a way of walking.

A trait that often triggers this reaction is a hint of\nspirituality, which can be devilishly seductive, like James Dean's interest in\nEastern philosophy and the occult. Hints of goodness and big-heartedness\ncan have a similar effect. Stars are like the gods on Mount Olympus, who\nlive for love and play. The things you love—people, hobbies, animals—\nreveal the kind of moral beauty that people like to see in a Star. Exploit this\ndesire by showing people peeks of your private life, the causes you fight for,\nthe person you are in love with (for the moment). Another way Stars seduce is by making us identify with them, giving us\na vicarious thrill. This was what Kennedy did in his press conference about\nTruman: in positioning himself as a young man wronged by an older man,\nevoking an archetypal generational conflict, he made young people identify\nwith him.

Once people have recognized a Star, any kind of\npublicity, even bad, simply feeds the obsession. Of course you can go too\nfar: people like a Star to have a transcendent beauty, and too much human\nfrailty will eventually disillusion them. But bad publicity is less of a danger\nthan disappearing for too long, or growing too distant. You cannot haunt\npeople's dreams if they never see you. At the same time, you cannot let the\npublic get too familiar with you, or let your image become predictable. People will turn against you in an instant if you begin to bore them, for\nboredom is the ultimate social evil. Perhaps the greatest danger Stars face is the endless attention they elicit. Obsessive attention can become disconcerting and worse. As any attractive\nwoman can attest, it is tiring to be gazed at all the time, and the effect can\nbe destructive, as is shown by the story of Marilyn Monroe.

Indiscretion\nis a sure sign of the Vulgarian (talking to others of your affair, for example);\nit may seem impulsive, but its real source is their radical selfishness, their in-\nability to see themselves as others see them. More than just avoiding Vul-\ngarians, you must make yourself their opposite—tact, style, and attention to\ndetail are all basic requirements of a seducer. Examples of the Anti-Seducer\n1. Claudius, the step-grandson of the great Roman emperor Augustus, was\nconsidered something of an imbecile as a young man, and was treated badly\nby almost everyone in his family. His nephew Caligula, who became em-\nperor in A.D. 37, made it a sport to torture him, making him run around\nthe palace at top speed as penance for his stupidity, having soiled sandals\ntied to his hands at supper, and so on.

So it came as a great\nsurprise to everyone, including Claudius himself, that when, in A.D. 41, a\ncabal of soldiers assassinated Caligula, they also proclaimed Claudius em-\nperor. Having no desire to rule, he delegated most of the governing to\nconfidantes (a group of freed slaves) and spent his time doing what he loved\nbest: eating, drinking, gambling, and whoring. Claudius's wife, Valeria Messalina, was one of the most beautiful\nwomen in Rome. Although he seemed fond of her, Claudius paid her no\nattention, and she started to have affairs. At first she was discreet, but over\nthe years, provoked by her husband's neglect, she became more and more\ndebauched. She had a room built for her in the palace where she enter-\ntained scores of men, doing her best to imitate the most notorious prosti-\ntute in Rome, whose name was written on the door. Any man who refused\nher advances was put to death. Almost everyone in Rome knew about\nthese frolics, but Claudius said nothing; he seemed oblivious. So great was Messalina's passion for her favorite lover, Gaius Silius, that\nshe decided to marry him, although both of them were married already. While Claudius was away, they held a wedding ceremony, authorized by a\nmarriage contract that Claudius himself had been tricked into signing. Af-\nter the ceremony, Gaius moved into the palace.",

Nothing is more infuriating than being paid no attention. In the process of\nseduction, you may have to pull back at times, subjecting your target to\nmoments of doubt. But prolonged inattention will not only break the se-\nductive spell, it can create hatred. Claudius was an extreme of this behavior. His insensitivity was created by necessity: in acting like an imbecile, he hid\nhis ambition and protected himself among dangerous competitors. But the\ninsensitivity became second nature. Claudius grew slovenly, and no longer\nnoticed what was going on around him. His inattentiveness had a profound\neffect on his wife: How, she wondered, can a man, especially a physically\nunappealing man like Claudius, not notice me, or care about my affairs\nwith other men?

There is nothing more anti-seductive than feeling that someone has assumed\nthat you are theirs, that you cannot possibly resist them. The slightest ap-\npearance of this kind of conceit is deadly to seduction; you must prove\nyourself, take your time, win your target's heart. Perhaps you fear that he or\nshe will be offended by a slower pace, or will lose interest. It is more likely,\nhowever, that your fear reflects your own insecurity, and insecurity is always\nanti-seductive. In truth, the longer you take, the more you show the depth\nof your interest, and the deeper the spell you create. In a world of few formalities and ceremony, seduction is one of the few\nremnants from the past that retains the ancient patterns. It is a ritual, and its\nrites must be observed. Haste reveals not the depth of your feelings but the\ndegree of your self-absorption. It may be possible sometimes to hurry\nsomeone into love, but you will only be repaid by the lack of pleasure this\nkind of love affords.

The truth about this type is not that they are searching for an ideal\nbut that they are hopelessly unhappy with themselves. You may mistake\ntheir dissatisfaction for a perfectionist's high standards, but in point of fact\nnothing will really satisfy them, for their unhappiness is deep-rooted. You\ncan recognize them by their past, which will be littered with short-lived,\nstormy romances. Also, they will tend to compare you to others, and to try\nto remake you. You may not realize at first what you have gotten into, but\npeople like this will eventually prove hopelessly anti-seductive because they\ncannot see your individual qualities.

In 1762, in the city of Turin, Italy, Giovanni Giacomo Casanova made\nthe acquaintance of one Count A.B., a Milanese gentleman who seemed to\nlike him enormously. The count had fallen on hard times and Casanova\nlent him some money. In gratitude, the count invited Casanova to stay with\nhim and his wife in Milan. His wife, he said, was from Barcelona, and was\nadmired far and wide for her beauty. He showed Casanova her letters,\nwhich had an intriguing wit; Casanova imagined her as a prize worth se-\nducing. He went to Milan.",

Arriving at the house of Count A.B., Casanova found that the Spanish\nlady was certainly beautiful, but that she was also quiet and serious. Some-\nthing about her bothered him. As he was unpacking his clothes, the count-\ness saw a stunning red dress, trimmed with sable, among his belongings. It\nwas a gift, Casanova explained, for any Milanese lady who won his heart. The following evening at dinner, the countess was suddenly more\nfriendly, teasing and bantering with Casanova. She described the dress as a\nbribe—he would use it to persuade a woman to give in to him. On the\ncontrary, said Casanova, he only gave gifts afterward, as tokens of his appre-\nciation. That evening, in a carriage on the way back from the opera, she\nasked him if a wealthy friend of hers could buy the dress, and when he said\nno, she was clearly vexed. Sensing her game, Casanova offered to give her\nthe sable dress if she was kind to him. This only made her angry, and they\nquarreled. Finally Casanova had had enough of the countess's moods: he sold the\ndress for 15,000 francs to her wealthy friend, who in turn gave it to her, as\nshe had planned all along.",

But to prove his lack of interest in money,\nCasanova told the countess he would give her the 15,000 francs, no strings\nattached. \"You are a very bad man,\" she said, \"but you can stay, you amuse\nme.\" She resumed her coquettish manner, but Casanova was not fooled. \"It\nis not my fault, madame, if your charms have so little power over me,\" he\ntold her. \"Here are 15,000 francs to console you.\" He laid the money on a\ntable and walked out, leaving the countess fuming and vowing revenge. When Casanova first met the Spanish lady, two things about her repelled\nhim. First, her pride: rather than engaging in the give-and-take of seduc-\ntion, she demanded a man's subjugation. Pride can reflect self-assurance,\nsignaling that you will not abase yourself before others. Just as often,\nthough, it stems from an inferiority complex, which demands that others\nabase themselves before you. Seduction requires an openness to the other\nperson, a willingness to bend and adapt. Excessive pride, without anything\nto justify it, is highly anti-seductive. The second quality that disgusted Casanova was the countess's greed:\nher coquettish little games were designed only to get the dress—she had no\ninterest in romance. For Casanova, seduction was a lighthearted game that\npeople played for their mutual amusement.",

She had met\nhim before, and knew his reputation as a moral absolutist, but this was to be\na ceremony, an exchange of pleasantries. Gladstone, however, had no pa-\ntience for such things.

As the head of the Liberal Party, Gladstone had a nemesis, Benjamin\nDisraeli, the head of the Conservative Party. He considered Disraeli amoral,\na devilish Jew. At one session of Parliament, Gladstone tore into his rival,\nscoring point after point as he described where his opponents policies\nwould lead. Growing angry as he spoke (as usually happened when he\ntalked of Disraeli), he pounded the speaker's table with such force that pens\nand papers went flying. Through all of this Disraeli seemed half-asleep. When Gladstone had finished, he opened his eyes, rose to his feet, and\ncalmly walked up to the table. \"The right honorable gentleman,\" he said,\n\"has spoken with much passion, much eloquence, and much—ahem—\nviolence.\" Then, after a drawn-out pause, he continued, \"But the damage\ncan be repaired\"—and he proceeded to gather up everything that had fallen 144 • The Art of Seduction\nfrom the table and put them back in place.",

If Disraeli was the consummate social seducer and charmer, Gladstone was\nthe Anti-Seducer. Of course he had supporters, mostly among the more\npuritanical elements of society—he twice defeated Disraeli in a general\nelection. But he found it hard to broaden his appeal beyond the circle of\nbelievers. Women in particular found him insufferable. Of course they had\nno vote at the time, so they were little political liability; but Gladstone had\nno patience for a feminine point of view.

It did not take long for Gladstone to wear on anyone's nerves.

Cleopatra had a devastating effect on every man who crossed her path. Octavius—the future Emperor Augustus, and the man who would de-\nfeat and destroy Cleopatra's lover Mark Antony—was well aware of her\npower, and defended himself against it by being always extremely amiable\nwith her, courteous to the extreme, but never showing the slightest emo-\ntion, whether of interest or dislike. In other words, he treated her as if she\nwere any other woman. Facing this front, she could not sink her hooks into\nhim. Octavius made anti-seduction his defense against the most irresistible\nwoman in history. Remember: seduction is a game of attention, of slowly\nfilling the other person's mind with your presence. Distance and inattention\nwill create the opposite effect, and can be used as a tactic when the need\narises. Finally, if you really want to \"anti-seduce,\" simply feign the qualities\nlisted at the beginning of the chapter.

The Eighteen Types\nThe people around you are all potential victims of a\nseduction, but first you must know what type of vic-\ntim you are dealing with. Victims are categorized\nby what they feel they are missing in life—ad-\nventure, attention, romance, a naughty expe-\nrience, mental or physical stimulation, etc. Once you identify their type, you have\nthe necessary ingredients for a seduc-\ntion: you will be the one to give\nthem what they lack and cannot\nget on their own. In studying\npotential victims, learn to see\nthe reality behind the ap-\npearance. A timid person\nmay yearn to play the\nstar; a prude may\nlong for a trans-\ngressive thrill.

But the seducer does not leave such things to chance. Look at the people around you.

Pay\nclose attention to their clothes, their gestures, their offhand comments, the\nthings in their house, certain looks in their eyes; get them to talk about\ntheir past, particularly past romances.

Most important: expunge the nasty habit of thinking that other peo-\nple have the same lacks you do.

People of this type were once happy-go-\nlucky seducers who had their way with the opposite sex. But the day came\nwhen they were forced to give this up—someone corraled them into a rela-\ntionship, they were encountering too much social hostility, they were get-\nting older and decided to settle down. Whatever the reason, you can be\nsure they feel some resentment and a sense of loss, as if a limb were miss-\ning. We are always trying to recapture pleasures we experienced in the past,\nbut the temptation is particularly great for the Reformed Rake or Siren be-\ncause the pleasures they found in seduction were intense. These types are\nripe for the picking: all that is required is that you cross their path and offer\nthem the opportunity to resume their rakish or siren ways. Their blood will\nstir and the call of their youth will overwhelm them. It is critical, though, to give these types the illusion that they are the\nones doing the seducing. With the Reformed Rake, you must spark his in-\nterest indirectly, then let him burn and glow with desire. With the Re-\nformed Siren, you want to give her the impression that she still has the\nirresistible power to draw a man in and make him give up everything for\nher.",

The Disappointed Dreamer. As children, these types probably spent a lot\nof time alone. To entertain themselves they developed a powerful fantasy\nlife, fed by books and films and other kinds of popular culture. And as they\nget older, it becomes increasingly difficult to reconcile their fantasy life\nwith reality, and so they are often disappointed by what they get.

What separates Novices from ordinary innocent young peo-\nple is that they are fatally curious. They have little or no experience of the\nworld, but have been exposed to it secondhand—in newspapers, films,\nbooks. Finding their innocence a burden, they long to be initiated into the\nways of the world. Everyone sees them as so sweet and innocent, but they\nknow this isn't so—they cannot be as angelic as people think them. Seducing a Novice is easy. To do it well, however, requires a bit of art. Novices are interested in people with experience, particularly people with\na touch of corruption and evil. Make that touch too strong, though, and it\nwill intimidate and frighten them. What works best with a Novice is a mix\nof qualities. You are somewhat childlike yourself, with a playful spirit. At\nthe same time, it is clear that you have hidden depths, even sinister ones.

Do not make your seduction ugly or seedy—\neverything must be romantic, even including the evil and dark side of life. Young people have their ideals; it is best to initiate them with an aesthetic\ntouch. Seductive language works wonders on Novices, as does attention to\ndetail. Spectacles and colorful events appeal to their sensitive senses. They\nare easily misled by these tactics, because they lack the experience to see\nthrough them.

When it comes time to apply these tactics, you will want to pick and\nchoose which ones are appropriate for your particular victim; sometimes\nonly a few are sufficient, depending on the level of resistance you meet and\nthe complexity of your victim's problems. These tactics are equally applica-\nble to social and political seductions, minus the sexual component in Phase\nFour. At all cost, resist the temptation to hurry to the climax of your seduc-\ntion, or to improvise. You are not being seductive but selfish. Everything in\ndaily life is hurried and improvised, and you need to offer something differ-\nent. By taking your time and respecting the seductive process you will not\nonly break down your victim's resistance, you will make them fall in love.

Your goal in this initial phase is to\nslowly separate them from that closed world and fill their minds\nwith thoughts of you. Once you have decided whom to seduce\n(1: Choose the right victim), your first task is to get your vic-\ntims' attention, to stir interest in you. For those who might be\nmore resistant or difficult, you should try a slower and more in-\nsidious approach, first winning their friendship (2: Create a\nfalse sense of security—approach indirectly); for those who are\nbored and less difficult to reach, a more dramatic approach will\nwork, either fascinating them with a mysterious presence (3:\nSend mixed signals) or seeming to be someone who is coveted\nand fought over by others (4: Appear to be an object of desire). Once the victim is properly intrigued, you need to transform\ntheir interest into something stronger—desire. Desire is generally\npreceded by feelings of emptiness, of something missing inside\nthat needs fulfillment. You must deliberately instill such feelings,\nmake your victims aware of the adventure and romance that are\nlacking in their lives (5: Create a need—stir anxiety and dis-\ncontent).

But after a while the repetitiveness of it\nall began to bore him; his successes came too easily So one year, during the\nsweltering, slow month of August, he decided to take a break from Paris\nand visit his aunt at her château in the provinces. Life there was not what\nhe was used to—there were country walks, chats with the local vicar, card\ngames. His city friends, particularly his fellow libertine and confidante the\nMarquise de Merteuil, expected him to hurry back. There were other guests at the château, however, including the Prési-\ndente de Tourvel, a twenty-two-year-old woman whose husband was tem-\nporarily absent, having work to do elsewhere. The Présidente had been\nlanguishing at the château, waiting for him to join her.

He caught glimpses of her at\ndinner, or playing cards. Unlike the ladies of Paris, she seemed unaware of\nher charms; this excited him. Because of the heat, she wore a simple linen\ndress, which revealed her figure. A piece of muslin covered her breasts, let-\nting him more than imagine them. Her hair, unfashionable in its slight dis-\norder, conjured the bedroom. And her face—he had never noticed how\nexpressive it was. Her features lit up when she gave alms to a beggar; she\nblushed at the slightest praise. She was so natural and unself-conscious.

In April of 1669, the Grande Mademoiselle, then forty-two, met one\nof the strangest men in the court: the Marquis Antonin Peguilin, later\nknown as the Duke de Lauzun. A favorite of Louis XIV's, the thirty-six-\nyear-old Marquis was a brave soldier with an acid wit. He was also an in-\ncurable Don Juan.

But it was only this time, in 1669, that\nshe had a real conversation with him, if a short one, and although she knew\nof his lady-killer reputation, she found him charming. A few days later they\nran into each other again; this time the conversation was longer, and\nLauzun proved more intelligent than she had imagined—they talked of the\nplaywright Corneille (her favorite), of heroism, and of other elevated top-\nics.

Instead of locking him up, Napoleon al-\nlowed him to wander around French territory, keeping a close watch on\nhim through spies.

In 1807 he decided to\nvisit the Château de Coppet, in Switzerland, where lived the great French\nwriter Madame de Stae'l.

Its source is less what you say or do, or any kind of boasting or self-\nadvertisement, than the sense that other people desire you. To turn your\ntargets' interest into something deeper, into desire, you must make them\nsee you as a person whom others cherish and covet. Desire is both imitative\n(we like what others like) and competitive (we want to take away from oth-\ners what they have). As children, we wanted to monopolize the attention of\na parent, to draw it away from other siblings. This sense of rivalry pervades\nhuman desire, repeating throughout our lives. Make people compete for\nyour attention, make them see you as sought after by everyone else. The\naura of desirability will envelop you. Your admirers can be friends or even suitors.

He\nliked to study with the Chambers sisters, particularly Jessie; she was shy and\nserious, and getting her to open up and confide in him was a pleasurable\nchallenge.

The desire to have someone fill up our emptiness\nis the weakness on which all seducers prey. Make people anxious about the\nfuture, make them depressed, make them question their identity, make\nthem sense the boredom that gnaws at their life. The ground is prepared. The seeds of seduction can be sown. In Plato's dialogue Symposium—the West's oldest treatise on love, and a\ntext that has had a determining influence on our ideas of desire—the cour-\ntesan Diotima explains to Socrates the parentage of Eros, the god of love. Eros's father was Contrivance, or Cunning, and his mother was Poverty, or\nNeed. Eros takes after his parents: he is constantly in need, which he is con-\nstantly contriving to fill. As the god of love, he knows that love cannot be\ninduced in another person unless they too feel need. And that is what his\narrows do: piercing people's flesh, they make them feel a lack, an ache, a\nhunger. This is the essence of your task as a seducer. Like Eros, you must\ncreate a wound in your victim, aiming at their soft spot, the chink in their\nself-esteem. If they are stuck in a rut, make them feel it more deeply, \"in-\nnocently\" bringing it up and talking about it.",

Cleopatra got Julius Caesar to sleep with her the first night he met her,\nbut the real seduction, the one that made him her slave, began later. In their\nensuing conversations she talked repeatedly of Alexander the Great, the\nhero from whom she was supposedly descended. No one could compare to\nhim. By implication, Caesar was made to feel inferior. Understanding that\nbeneath his bravado Caesar was insecure, Cleopatra awakened in him an\nanxiety, a hunger to prove his greatness. Once he felt this way he was easily\nfurther seduced. Doubts about his masculinity was his tender spot. When Caesar was assassinated, Cleopatra turned her sights on Mark\nAntony, one of Caesar's successors in the leadership of Rome. Antony\nloved pleasure and spectacle, and his tastes were crude.

There are many legends of Don Juan,\nbut they often describe him seducing a village girl by making her feel that\nher life is horribly provincial. He, meanwhile, wears glittering clothes and\nhas a noble bearing. Strange and exotic, he is always from somewhere else. First she feels the boredom of her life, then she sees him as her salvation. Remember: people prefer to feel that if their life is uninteresting, it not be-\ncause of themselves but because of their circumstances, the dull people\nthey know, the town into which they were born. Once you make them feel\nthe lure of the exotic, seduction is easy. Another devilishly seductive area to aim at is the victim's past.

In her later years, Queen Elizabeth I of En-\ngland was known as a rather stern and demanding ruler. She made it a point\nnot to let her courtiers see anything soft or weak in her. But then Robert\nDevereux, the second Earl of Essex, came to court. Much younger than\nthe queen, the dashing Essex would often chastize her for her sourness.

Besides, people resent your attempt to persuade them, as if\nthey were incapable of deciding by themselves—as if you knew better. Consider instead the power of insinuation and suggestion. It requires some\npatience and art, but the results are more than worth it. The way insinuation works is simple: disguised in a banal remark or en-\ncounter, a hint is dropped. It is about some emotional issue—a possible\npleasure not yet attained, a lack of excitement in a person's life. The hint\nregisters in the back of the target's mind, a subtle stab at his or her insecuri-\nties; its source is quickly forgotten.

The Indulgent Strategy\nIn October of 1961, the American journalist Cindy Adams was granted\nan exclusive interview with President Sukarno of Indonesia. It was a re-\nmarkable coup, for Adams was a little-known journalist at the time, while\nSukarno was a world figure in the midst of a crisis. A leader of the fight for\nIndonesia's independence, he had been the country's president since 1949,\nwhen the Dutch finally gave up the colony. By the early 1960s, his daring\nforeign policy had made him hated in the United States, some calling him\nthe Hitler of Asia. Adams decided that in the interests of a lively interview, she would not\nbe cowed or overawed by Sukarno, and she began the conversation by jok-\ning with him. To her pleasant surprise, her ice-breaking tactic seemed to\nwork: Sukarno warmed up to her. He let the interview run well over an\nhour, and when it was over he loaded her with gifts. Her success was re-\nmarkable enough, but even more so were the friendly letters she began\nto receive from Sukarno after she and her husband had returned to New\nYork. A few years later, he proposed that she collaborate with him on his\nautobiography.",

He was handsome, and obviously he was attracted to her, but\nwhy choose her for this prestigious task? Perhaps his libido was too power-\nful for him to care about such things.

During her first in-\nterview with him for the book, she complained in rather strong terms\nabout the rooms she had been given as lodgings.

Perhaps Sukarno's passes at Adams showed his uncontrollable libido at\nwork, or perhaps they were more cunning. He had a reputation as a Don\nJuan; failing to make a pass at her would have hurt her feelings. (Women\nare often less offended at being found attractive than one imagines, and\nSukarno was clever enough to have given each of his four wives the im-\npression that she was his favorite.) The pass out of the way, he moved fur-\nther into her spirit, taking on her casual air, even slightly feminizing himself\nby adopting her hair color. The result was that she decided he was not what\nshe had expected or feared him to be. He was not in the least threatening,\nand after all, she was the one in control.",

Of all the seductive tactics, entering someone's spirit is perhaps the\nmost devilish of all. It gives your victims the feeling that they are seducing\nyou. The fact that you are indulging them, imitating them, entering their\nspirit, suggests that you are under their spell. You are not a dangerous se-\nducer to be wary of, but someone compliant and unthreatening. The atten-\ntion you pay to them is intoxicating—since you are mirroring them,\neverything they see and hear from you reflects their own ego and tastes. What a boost to their vanity.

The way to lure people out of their natural in-\ntractability and self-obsession is to enter their spirit. All of us are narcissists. When we were children our narcissism was\nphysical: we were interested in our own image, our own body, as if it were\na separate being. As we grow older, our narcissism grows more psychologi-\ncal: we become absorbed in our own tastes, opinions, experiences. A hard\nshell forms around us. Paradoxically, the way to entice people out of this\nshell is to become more like them, in fact a kind of mirror image of them. You do not have to spend days studying their minds; simply conform to\ntheir moods, adapt to their tastes, play along with whatever they send your\nway. In doing so you will lower their natural defensiveness. Their sense of\nself-esteem does not feel threatened by your strangeness or different habits. People truly love themselves, but what they love most of all is to see their\nideas and tastes reflected in another person. This validates them. Their ha-\nbitual insecurity vanishes.

Soon she was editing\nhis poetry, and he hung on her every word. Salomé was flattered by Rilke's mirroring of her spirit, enchanted by\nthe intense attention he paid her and the spiritual communion they began\nto develop. She became his lover. But she was worried about his future; it\nwas difficult to make a living as a poet, and she encouraged him to learn\nher native language, Russian, and become a translator.

The young woman was elegantly dressed, but what took Don\nJuan's breath away was her resemblance to a woman he had known nearly\nthree years before. Surely she could not be the same person. The woman he\nhad known, Cristeta Moreruela, was a showgirl in a second-rate theater. She had been an orphan and was quite poor—her circumstances could not\nhave changed that much. He moved closer: the same beautiful face. And\nthen he heard her voice. He was so shocked that he had to sit down: it was\nindeed the same woman.",

Tracing the\nnursemaid during one of her errands, he struck up a conversation with her,\nand asked her about her mistress's husband.

Cristeta and Don Juan are characters in the novel Dulce y\nSabrosa (Sweet and Savory, 1891), by the Spanish writer Jacinto Octavio\nPicon.

The fruit once tasted, he no longer wanted it. What came\neasily to him, or fell into his arms, held no allure for him. What would\ntempt Don Juan into desiring Cristeta again, into pursuing her, was the\nsense that she was already taken, that she was forbidden fruit. That was his\nweakness—that was why he pursued virgins and married women, women\nhe was not supposed to have. To a man, she reasoned, the grass always\nseems greener somewhere else. She would make herself that distant, allur-\ning object, just out of reach, tantalizing him, stirring up emotions he could\nnot control. He knew how charming and desirable she had once been to\nhim. The idea of possessing her again, and the pleasure he imagined it\nwould bring, were too much for him: he swallowed the bait. Temptation is a twofold process.

Keys to Seduction\nMost of the time, people struggle to maintain security and a sense of\nbalance in their lives. If they were always uprooting themselves in\npursuit of every new person or fantasy that passed them by, they could not\nsurvive the daily grind. They usually win the struggle, but it does not come\neasy. The world is full of temptation. They read about people who have\nmore than they do, about adventures others are having, about people who\nhave found wealth and happiness. The security that they strive for, and that\nthey seem to have in their lives, is actually an illusion. It covers up a con-\nstant tension. As a seducer, you can never mistake people's appearance for reality. You\nknow that their fight to keep order in their lives is exhausting, and that they\nare gnawed by doubts and regrets. It is hard to be good and virtuous, always\nhaving to repress the strongest desires. With that knowledge in mind, se-\nduction is easier. What people want is not temptation; temptation happens\nevery day. What people want is to give into temptation, to yield. That is the\nonly way to get rid of the tension in their lives.",

Your task, then, is to create a temptation that is stronger than the daily\nvariety. It has to be focused on them, aimed at them as individuals—at their\nweakness. Understand: everyone has a principal weakness, from which oth-\ners stem. Find that childhood insecurity, that lack in their life, and you hold\nthe key to tempting them. Their weakness may be greed, vanity, boredom,\nsome deeply repressed desire, a hunger for forbidden fruit. They signal it in\nlittle details that elude their conscious control: their style of clothing, an\noffhand comment. Their past, and particularly their past romances, will be\nlittered with clues. Give them a potent temptation, tailored to their weak-\nness, and you can make the hope of pleasure that you stir in them figure\nmore prominently than the doubts and anxieties that accompany it.

Her father knew what kind\nof man Casanova was, and to prevent some mishap before he could marry\nher off, he sent her away to a convent on the Venetian island of Murano,\nwhere she was to remain for four years.

The nuns began to talk among themselves: who\nwas this handsome young man who appeared so often?

One such virgin, Shahrazad, manages to escape this fate by telling the\nking a story that can only be completed the following day. She does this\nnight after night, keeping the king in constant suspense. When one story\nfinishes, she quickly starts up another. She does this for nearly three years,\nuntil the king finally decides to spare her life. You are like Shahrazad: with-this king; either I shall die\nand be a ransom for the\ndaughters of Moslems, or\nlive and be the cause of\ntheir deliverance.\"",

For the last ten years de Gaulle had stayed away from politics, dis-\ngusted with the infighting among the various parties. He remained very\npopular, and was generally seen as the one man who could unite the country,\nbut he was also a conservative, and the right-wingers felt certain that if he\ncame to power he would support their cause.

Here\nhe described the state of his soul, and his certainty that he loved her. He\nspoke in metaphor, suggesting that he had been waiting for years, lantern in\nhand, for Cordelia's appearance; metaphor melted into reality, back and\nforth. The style was poetic, the words glowed with desire, but the whole\nwas delightfully ambiguous—Cordelia could reread the letter ten times\nwithout being sure what it said. The next day Johannes received a response. The writing was simple and straightforward, but full of sentiment: his letter\nhad made her so happy, Cordelia wrote, and she had not imagined this side\nto his character. He replied by writing that he had changed. He did not say\nhow or why, but the implication was that it was because of her. Now his letters came almost daily.

He talked of Greek myth, comparing Cordelia to a\nnymph and himself to a river that fell in love with a maiden. His soul, he\nsaid, merely reflected back her image; she was all he could see or think of. Meanwhile he detected changes in Cordelia: her letters became more po-\netic, less restrained. Without realizing it she repeated his ideas, imitating his\nstyle and his imagery as if they were her own. Also, when they saw each\nother in person, she was nervous. He made a point of remaining the same,\naloof and regal, but he could tell that she saw him differently, sensing\ndepths in him that she could not fathom. In public she hung on his every\nword. She must have memorized his letters, for she referred to them con-\nstantly in their talks. It was a secret life they shared. When she held his\nhand, she did so more tightly than before.

We think that by being persistent, by overwhelming our targets\nwith romantic attention, we are convincing them of our affection. Instead\nwe are convincing them of our impatience and insecurity. Aggressive atten-\ntion is not flattering because it is not personalized. It is unbridled libido at\nwork; the target sees through it. Johannes is too clever to begin so obvi-\nously. Instead, he takes a step back, intriguing Cordelia by acting a little\ncold, and carefully creating the impression of a formal, somewhat secretive\nman. Only then does he surprise her with his first letter. Obviously there is\nmore to him than she has thought, and once she has come to believe this,\nher imagination runs rampant.

Let your victims get an impression of you:\nyou seem intriguing, yet you show no particular interest in them. When\nyou sense that they are thinking about you, that is the time to hit them\nwith your first letter. Any desire you express for them will come as a sur-\nprise; their vanity will be tickled and they will want more. Now make your\nletters frequent, in fact more frequent than your personal appearances. This\nwill give them the time and space to idealize you, which would be more\ndifficult if you were always in their face. After they have fallen under your\nspell, you can always take a step back, making the letters fewer—let them\nthink you are losing interest and they will be hungry for more.

Antony used various devices to stir the crowd:\na tremor in his voice, a distraught and then an angry tone. An emotional\nvoice has an immediate, contagious effect on the listener. Antony also\nteased the crowd with the will, holding off the reading of it to the end,\nknowing it would push people over the edge. Holding up the cloak, he\nmade his imagery visceral. Perhaps you are not trying to whip a crowd into a frenzy; you just want\nto bring people over to your side. Choose your strategy and words carefully.

The Mesmerizing Effect\nIn December 1898, the wives of the seven major Western ambassadors to\nChina received a strange invitation: the sixty-three-year-old Empress\nDowager Tzu Hsi was hosting a banquet in their honor in the Forbidden\nCity in Beijing. The ambassadors themselves had been quite displeased\nwith the empress dowager, for several reasons. She was a Manchu, a race of\nnortherners who had conquered China in the early seventeenth century,\nestablishing the Ching Dynasty and ruling the country for nearly three\nhundred years.

Then, one hundred days into this period of\nreform, word reached the Western diplomats from the Forbidden City that\nthe emperor was quite ill, and that the empress dowager had taken power. They suspected foul play; the empress had probably acted to stop the re-\nforms. The emperor was being mistreated, probably poisoned—\nperhaps he was already dead.

Neverthe-\nless, the affair went on. In 1945, Perón was dismissed from his post and jailed. The colonels\nfeared his growing popularity and distrusted the power of his mistress, who\nseemed to have total influence over him. It was the first time in almost two\nyears that he was truly alone, and truly separated from Eva. Suddenly he felt\nnew emotions sweeping over him: he pinned her photographs all over the\nwall. Outside, massive strikes were being organized to protest his imprison-\nment, but all he could think about was Eva. She was a saint, a woman of\ndestiny, a heroine. He wrote to her, \"It is only being apart from loved ones\nthat we can measure our affection. From the day I left you ... I have not\nbeen able to calm my sad heart. . . .

Interpretation. The character of Valmont in Choderlos de Laclos's\nepistolary novel Dangerous Liaisons is based on several of the great real-life\nlibertines of eighteenth-century France. Everything Valmont does is calcu-\nlated for effect—the ambiguous actions that make Tourvel curious about\nhim, the act of charity in the village (he knows he is being followed), the\nreturn visit to the château, the paleness of his face (he is having an affair\nwith a girl at the château, and their all-night carousals give him a wasted\nlook). Most devastating of all is his positioning of himself as the weak one,\nthe seduced, the victim. How can the Présidente imagine he is manipulat-\ning her when everything suggests he is simply overwhelmed by her beauty,\nwhether physical or spiritual? He cannot be a deceiver when he repeatedly\nmakes a point of confessing the \"truth\" about himself: he admits that his\ncharity was questionably motivated, he explains why he has gone astray, he\nlets her in on his emotions. (All of this \"honesty,\" of course, is calculated.) In essence he is like a woman, or at least like a woman of those times—\nemotional, unable to control himself, moody, insecure.

She is the one who\nis cold and cruel, like a man. In positioning himself as Tourvel's victim, Val-\nmont can not only disguise his manipulations but elicit pity and concern. Playing the victim, he can stir up the tender emotions produced by a sick\nchild or a wounded animal. And these emotions are easily channeled into\nlove—as the Présidente discovers to her dismay. Seduction is a game of reducing suspicion and resistance. The cleverest\nway to do this is to make the other person feel stronger, more in control of\nthings. Suspicion usually comes out of insecurity; if your targets feel supe-\nrior and secure in your presence, they are unlikely to doubt your motives. You are too weak, too emotional, to be up to something. Take this game as\nfar as it will go. Flaunt your emotions and how deeply they have affected\nyou. Making people feel the power they have over you is immensely flatter-\ning to them. Confess to something bad, or even to something bad that you\ndid, or contemplated doing, to them.

Perhaps we are shy or oversensitive, or need attention—\nwhatever the weakness is, it is something we cannot control. We may try to\ncompensate for it, or to hide it, but this is often a mistake: people sense\nsomething inauthentic or unnatural. Remember: what is natural to your\ncharacter is inherently seductive. A person's vulnerability, what they seem\nto be unable to control, is often what is most seductive about them.

An\nunseduced, rational person, on the other hand, may find bashfulness or\nemotional outbursts pathetic. There are also certain weaknesses that have\nno seductive value, no matter how in love the target may be. The great seventeenth-century courtesan Ninon de l'Enclos liked men\nwith a soft side. But sometimes a man would go too far, complaining that\nshe did not love him enough, that she was too fickle and independent, that\nhe was being mistreated and wronged. For Ninon, such behavior would\nbreak the spell, and she would quickly end the relationship. Complaining,\nwhining, neediness, and actively appealing for sympathy will appear to your\ntargets not as charming weaknesses but as manipulative attempts at a kind of\nnegative power. So when you play the victim, do it subtly, without overad-\nvertising it. The only weaknesses worth playing up are the ones that will\nmake you seem lovable. All others should be repressed and eradicated at all\ncosts. Confuse Desire and Reality—\nThe Perfect Illusion\nTo\ncompensate for the difficulties in their\nlives, people spend a lot of their time daydreaming, imag-\nining a future full of adventure, success, and romance. If you can\ncreate the illusion that through you they can live out their\ndreams, you will have them at your mercy. It is im-\nportant to start slowly, gaining their trust,\nand gradually constructing the fantasy\nthat matches their desires.",

Fantasy in the Flesh\nIn 1964, a twenty-year-old Frenchman named Bernard Bouriscout ar-\nrived in Beijing, China, to work as an accountant in the French embassy. His first weeks there were not what he had expected. Bouriscout had\ngrown up in the French provinces, dreaming of travel and adventure. When he had been assigned to come to China, images of the Forbidden\nCity, and of the gambling dens of Macao, had danced in his mind. But this\nwas Communist China, and contact between Westerners and Chinese was\nalmost impossible at the time. Bouriscout had to socialize with the other\nEuropeans stationed in the city, and what a boring and cliquish lot they\nwere. He grew lonely, regretted taking the assignment, and began making\nplans to leave. Then, at a Christmas party that year, Bouriscout's eyes were drawn to a\nyoung Chinese man in a corner of the room.",

The man was intriguing: he was slender and\nshort, a bit reserved, but he had an attractive presence. Bouriscout went up\nand introduced himself. The man, Shi Pei Pu, proved to be a writer of\nChinese-opera librettos who also taught Chinese to members of the\nFrench embassy. Aged twenty-six, he spoke perfect French. Everything\nabout him fascinated Bouriscout; his voice was like music, soft and whis-\npery, and he left you wanting to know more about him. Bouriscout, al-\nthough usually shy, insisted on exchanging telephone numbers. Perhaps Pei\nPu could be his Chinese tutor. They met a few days later in a restaurant. Bouriscout was the only\nWesterner there—at last a taste of something real and exotic. Pei Pu, it\nturned out, had been a well-known actor in Chinese operas and came from\na family with connections to the former ruling dynasty. Now he wrote\noperas about the workers, but he said this with a look of irony They began\nto meet regularly, Pei Pu showing Bouriscout the sights of Beijing.

He listened as Pei Pu told them \"The Story of the Butterfly,\" a\ntale from the Chinese opera: a young girl yearns to attend an imperial\nschool, but girls are not accepted there. She disguises herself as a boy, passes\nthe exams, and enters the school. A fellow student falls in love with her,\nand she is attracted to him, so she tells him that she is actually a girl. Like\nmost of these tales, the story ends tragically. Pei Pu told it with unusual\nemotion; in fact he had played the role of the girl in the opera. A few nights later, as they were walking before the gates of the Forbid-\nden City, Pei Pu returned to \"The Story of the Butterfly\" \"Look at my\nhands,\" he said, \"Look at my face.

But the mother was too frightened to reveal the truth,\nand made an agreement with the midwife: they would say that the child\nwas a boy, and it would be raised as such. This third child was Pei Pu. Over the years, Pei Pu had had to go to extreme lengths to disguise her\nsex. She never used public bathrooms, plucked her hairline to look as if she\nwere balding, on and on. Bouriscout was enthralled by the story, and also\nrelieved, for like the boy in the butterfly tale, deep down he felt attracted to\nPei Pu. Now everything made sense—the small hands, the high-pitched\nvoice, the delicate neck. He had fallen in love with her, and, it seemed, the\nfeelings were reciprocated. Pei Pu started visiting Bouriscout's apartment, and soon they were\nsleeping together.

The\nCultural Revolution broke out in China, and he lost contact with her. Be-\nfore he had left, she had told him she was pregnant with their child. He had\nno idea whether the baby had been born. His obsession with her grew too\nstrong, and in 1969 he finagled another government job in Beijing.

She told him she had\nborne a son, in 1966, but he had looked like Bouriscout, and given the\ngrowing hatred of foreigners in China, and the need to keep the secret of\nher sex, she had him sent him away to an isolated region near Russia.

Less consciously, he had an outlet for his repressed homo-\nsexuality. Pei Pu embodied his fantasy, giving it flesh, by working first on\nhis mind. The mind has two currents: it wants to believe in things that are\npleasant to believe in, yet it has a self-protective need to be suspicious of\npeople. If you start off too theatrical, trying too hard to create a fantasy,\nyou will feed that suspicious side of the mind, and once fed, the doubts will\nnot go away. Instead, you must start slowly, building trust, while perhaps\nletting people see a little touch of something strange or exciting about you\nto tease their interest.

Her marriage\nto Orson Welles was breaking up, her mother had died, and her career\nseemed stalled. That summer she headed for Europe.

Your worst enemies in a seduction are often your targets' family and\nfriends. They are outside your circle and immune to your charms; they may\nprovide a voice of reason to the seduced.

The seductive power of isolation goes beyond the sexual realm. When\nnew adherents joined Mahatma Gandhi's circle of devoted followers, they\nwere encouraged to cut off their ties with the past—with their family and\nfriends. This kind of renunciation has been a requirement of many reli-\ngious sects over the centuries. People who isolate themselves in this way are\nmuch more vulnerable to influence and persuasion. A charismatic politi-\ncian feeds off and even encourages people's feelings of alienation. John F.\nKennedy did this to great effect when he subtly disparaged the Eisenhower\nyears; the comfort of the 1950s, he implied, compromised American ideals. He invited Americans to join him in a new life, on a \"New Frontier,\" full\nof danger and excitement. It was an extremely seductive lure, particularly\nfor the young, who were Kennedy's most enthusiastic supporters. Finally, at some point in the seduction there must be a hint of danger in\nthe mix.

If\nthey resist your efforts, it is proba-\nbly because you have not gone far\nenough to allay their doubts—about\nyour motives, the depth of your feel-\nings, and so on. One well-timed ac-\ntion that shows how far you are\nwilling to go to win them over will\ndispel their doubts. Do not worry\nabout looking foolish or making a\nmistake—any kind of deed that is\nself-sacrificing and for your targets'\nsake will so overwhelm their emo-\ntions, they won't notice anything else. Never appear discouraged by people's\nresistance, or complain. Instead, meet\nthe challenge by doing something ex-\ntreme or chivalrous. Conversely, spur\nothers to prove themselves by making\nyourself hard to reach, unattain-\nable, worth fighting over. Seductive Evidence\nAnyone can talk big, say lofty things about their feelings, insist on how\nmuch they care for us, and also for all oppressed peoples in the far\nreaches of the planet. But if they never behave in a way that will back up\ntheir words, we begin to doubt their sincerity—perhaps we are dealing\nwith a charlatan, or a hypocrite or a coward.

Brave or selfless deeds create a\npowerful and positive emotional reaction. Don't worry, your deeds do not\nhave to be so brave and selfless that you lose everything in the process. The\nappearance alone of nobility will often suffice. In fact, in a world where\npeople overanalyze and talk too much, any kind of action has a bracing, se-\nductive effect. It is normal in the course of a seduction to encounter resistance. The\nmore obstacles you overcome, of course, the greater the pleasure that awaits\nyou, but many a seduction fails because the seducer does not correctly read\nthe resistances of the target. More often than not, you give up too easily. First, understand a primary law of seduction: resistance is a sign that the\nother person's emotions are engaged in the process. The only person you\ncannot seduce is somebody distant and cold.

Of course the major was a decorated soldier, well\neducated, an accomplished dancer, and one of the most handsome men in\nthe army.

D'Annunzio's role so far had been completely pre-\ndictable. But what did surprise the Italian public was what this fifty-two-\nyear-old man did next: he joined the army. He had never served in the\nmilitary, boats made him seasick, but he could not be dissuaded. Eventually\nthe authorities gave him a post in a cavalry division, hoping to keep him\nout of combat.

Told his fly-\ning days were over, he convalesced in his home in Venice. At the time, the\nmost beautiful and fashionable woman in Italy was generally considered to\nbe the Countess Morosini, former mistress of the German Kaiser. Her\npalace was on the Grand Canal, opposite the home of D'Annunzio. Now\nshe found herself besieged by letters and poems from the writer-soldier,\nmixing details of his flying exploits with declarations of his love. In the\nmiddle of air raids on Venice, he would cross the canal, barely able to see\nout of one eye, to deliver his latest poem. D'Annunzio was much beneath\nMorosini's station, a mere writer, but his willingness to brave anything on\nher behalf won her over. The fact that his reckless behavior could get him\nkilled any day only hastened the seduction. D'Annunzio ignored the doctors' advice and returned to flying, leading\neven more daring raids than before. By the end of the war, he was Italy's\nmost decorated hero. Now, wherever in the nation he appeared, the public\nfilled the piazzas to hear his speeches.",

He thought he knew\nwhat was happening: encouraged by Freud, the patient would delve into\nher childhood, which of course was the source of her illness or neurosis. She would talk about her relationship with her father, her earliest experi-\nences of tenderness and love, and also of neglect and abandonment.

She mixes plenty of praise and approval in with her taunts. Once the man\nbegins to regress, she adds physical excitement—some bodily contact to ex-\ncite him, subtle sexual overtones. As a reward for his regression, the man may\nget the thrill of finally sleeping with his mother. But there is always an ele-\nment of competition, which the mother figure must heighten. The man\ngets to possess her all on his own, something he could not do with father in\nthe way, but he first has to win her away from others. The key to this kind of regression is to see and treat your targets as chil-\ndren.",

Chateaubriand spent much of his time with his sister Lucile, and his attach-\nment to her was strong enough that rumors of incest made the rounds. But\nwhen he was around fifteen, a new woman named Sylphide entered his\nlife—a woman he created in his imagination, a composite of all the hero-\nines, goddesses, and courtesans he had read about in books. He was con-\nstantly seeing her features in his mind, and hearing her voice. Soon she was\ntaking walks with him, carrying on conversations.

Some time in the summer of 1614, several members of England's upper\nnobility, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, met to decide what to\ndo about the Earl of Somerset, the favorite of King James I, who was\nforty-eight at the time.

Left to nature, though, the seduction\nwould never happen. They had to help it along. So, without telling Villiers\nof their plan, they befriended him. King James was the son of Mary Queen of Scots.

The poem was filled\nwith familiar gothic imagery—a dilapidated abbey, debauchery, travels to\nthe mysterious East—but what made it different was that the hero of the\npoem was also its villain: Harold was a man who led a life of vice, disdain-\ning society's conventions yet somehow going unpunished.

He lingered in her boudoir, played with\nher children, helped her choose her dress for the day. She pressed him to\ntalk of his life: he described his brutal father, the untimely deaths that\nseemed to be a family curse, the crumbling abbey he had inherited, his ad-\nventures in Turkey and Greece. His life was indeed as gothic as that of\nChilde Harold. Within days the two became lovers. Now, though, the tables turned:\nLady Caroline pursued Byron with unladylike aggression. She dressed as a\npage and sneaked into his carriage, wrote him extravagantly emotional let-\nters, flaunted the affair. At last, a chance to play the grand romantic role of\nher girlhood fantasies. Byron began to turn against her. He already loved to\nshock; now he confessed to her the nature of the secret sin he had alluded\nto in Childe Harold—his homosexual affairs during his travels. He made\ncruel remarks, grew indifferent. But this only seemed to push her further.

In 1813, an old friend of Byron's, James Webster, invited the poet to\nstay at his country estate. Webster had a young and beautiful wife, Lady\nFrances, and he knew Byron's reputation as a seducer, but his wife was\nquiet and chaste—surely she would resist the temptation of a man such as\nByron. To Webster's relief, Byron barely spoke to Frances, who seemed\nequally uninterested in him. Yet several days into Byron's stay, she contrived\nto be alone with him in the billiards room, where she asked him a question:\nhow could a woman who liked a man inform him of it when he did not\nperceive it? Byron scribbled a racy reply on a piece of paper, which made\nher blush as she read it. Soon thereafter he invited the couple to stay with\nhim at his infamous abbey. There, the prim and proper Lady Frances saw\nhim drink wine from a human skull. They stayed up late in one of the\nabbey's secret chambers, reading poetry and kissing.

Annabella Milbanke, Lady Caroline Lamb's cousin, had met Byron in\nthose first months of 1812 when he was the toast of London. Annabella\nwas sober and down to earth, and her interests were science and religion. But there was something about Byron that attracted her. And the feeling\nseemed to be returned: not only did the two become friends, to her bewil-\nderment he showed another kind of interest in her, even at one point\nproposing marriage. This was in the midst of the scandal over Byron and\nCaroline Lamb, and Annabella did not take the proposal seriously. Over the\nnext few months she followed his career from a distance, and heard the\ntroubling rumors of incest. Yet in 1813, she wrote her aunt, \"I consider his\nacquaintance as so desirable that I would incur the risk of being called a\nFlirt for the sake of enjoying it.\" Reading his new poems, she wrote that his\n\"description of Love almost makes me in love.\" She was developing an ob-\nsession with Byron, of which word soon reached him.",

He\ntold Annabella, \"Now you will find that you have married a devil.\" Within\na few years the marriage fell apart. In 1816, Byron left England, never to return. He traveled through Italy\nfor a while; everyone knew his story—the affairs, the incest, the cruelty to\nhis lovers. But wherever he went, Italian women, particularly married no-\nblewomen, pursued him, making it clear in their own way how prepared\nthey were to be the next Byronic victim.

The\nstrategy, though, can be applied to a person of any age: for every deeply\nheld value there is a shadow side, a doubt, a desire to explore what those\nvalues forbid. In Renaissance Italy, a prostitute would dress as a lady and go to\nchurch. Nothing was more exciting to a man than to exchange glances\nwith a woman whom he knew to be a whore as he was surrounded by his\nwife, family, peers, and church officials.

A mix of the masculine and the feminine, the violent and\nthe tender, will always seem transgressive and appealing. Love is supposed\nto be tender and delicate, but in fact it can release violent and destructive\nemotions; and the possible violence of love, the way it breaks down our\nnormal reasonableness, is just what attracts us. Approach romance's violent\nside by mixing a cruel streak into your tender attentions, particularly in the\nlatter stages of the seduction, when the target is in your clutches.

Byron's seductive appeal to\nLady Frances was connected to the nearness of her husband—in his com-\npany, for example, she had a love letter of Byron's hidden in her bosom. Jo-\nhannes, the protagonist of Søren Kierkegaard's The Seducer's Diary, sent a\nmessage to his target, the young Cordelia, in the middle of a dinner party\nthey were both attending; she could not reveal to the other guests that it\nwas from him, for then she would have to do some explaining.

Epitomizing the concept of love in the Western world, the legend has\nhad immense influence over the ages, and a crucial part of it is the idea\nthat without obstacles, without a feeling of transgression, love is weak and\nflavorless. People may be straining to remove restrictions on private behavior, to\nmake everything freer, in the world today, but that only makes seduction\nmore difficult and less exciting. Do what you can to reintroduce a feeling\nof transgression and crime, even if it is only psychological or illusory. There must be obstacles to overcome, social norms to flout, laws to break,\nbefore the seduction can be consummated. It might seem that a permissive\nsociety imposes few limits; find some. There will always be limits, sacred\ncows, behavioral standards—endless ammunition for stirring up the trans-\ngressive and taboo. 358 • The Art of Seduction\nSymbol: The Forest.

Half of Picasso's appeal to many women was the hope that he would\nimmortalize them in his paintings—for Ars longa, vita brevis (Art is long, life\nis short), as they used to say in Rome. Even if your love is a passing fancy,\nby capturing it in a work of art you give it a seductive illusion of eternity. The second way to use art is to make it ennoble the affair, giving your se-\nduction an elevated edge. Natalie Barney took her targets to the theater, to\nthe opera, to museums, to places full of history and atmosphere. In such\nplaces your souls can vibrate to the same spiritual wavelength. Of course\nyou should avoid works of art that are earthy or vulgar, calling attention to\nyour intentions.

Don Mateo liked young girls, and\nhundreds of them worked in the factory. Just as he had expected, that day\nmany of them were in a state of near undress because of the heat—it was\nquite a spectacle. He enjoyed the sights for a while, but the noise and the\ntemperature soon got to him. As he was heading for the door, though, a\nworker of no more than sixteen called out to him: \"Caballero, if you will\ngive me a penny I will sing you a little song.\" The girl's name was Conchita Pérez, and she looked young and inno-\ncent, in fact beautiful, with a sparkle in her eye that suggested a taste for ad-\nventure. The perfect prey. He listened to her song (which seemed vaguely\nsuggestive), tossed her a coin that was equal to a month's salary, tipped his\nhat, then left.

Don Mateo and Conchita Perez are characters in the 1896\nnovella Woman and Puppet, by Pierre Louÿs. Based on a true story—the\n\"Miss Charpillon\" episode in Casanova's Memoirs—the novella has served as\nthe basis for two films: Josef von Sternberg's Devil Is a Woman, with Mar-\nlene Dietrich, and Luis Buñuel's That Obscure Object of Desire. In Louÿs's\nstory, Conchita takes a proud and aggressive older man and in the space of a\nfew months turns him into an abject slave.

It would be an enjoyable challenge to\noutwit her and prove that he was tougher. He agreed to a short interview a\nfew days later. To Kissinger's annoyance, Fallaci began the interview by asking him\nwhether he was disappointed by the slow pace of the peace negotiations\nwith North Vietnam. He would not discuss the negotiations—he had made\nthat clear in the preinterview. Yet she continued the same line of question-\ning. He grew a little angry \"That's enough,\" he said. \"I don't want to\ntalk any more about Vietnam.\" Although she didn't immediately aban-\ndon the subject, her questions became gentler: what were his personal feel-\nings toward the leaders of South and North Vietnam? Still, he ducked:\n\"I'm not the kind of person to be swayed by emotion. Emotions serve\nno purpose.\" She moved to grander philosophical issues—war, peace.

To get a quicker result, and to\nbreak down more inaccessible people, it is often better to alternate harsh-\nness and kindness. By being harsh you create inner tensions—your targets\nmay be upset with you, but they are also asking themselves questions. What\nhave they done to earn your dislike? When you then are kind, they feel\nrelieved, but also concerned that at any moment they might somehow dis-\nplease you again. Make use of this pattern to keep them in suspense—\ndreading your harshness and keen to keep you kind. Your kindness and\nharshness should be subtle; indirect digs and compliments are best. Play the\npsychoanalyst: make cutting comments concerning their unconscious mo-\ntives (you are only being truthful), then sit back and listen. Your silence will\ngoad them into embarrassing admissions. Leaven your judgments with oc-\ncasional praise and they will strive to please you, like dogs.

You are most often nice not out of your own inner good-\nness but out of fear of displeasing, out of insecurity. Go beyond that fear\nand you suddenly have options—the freedom to create pain, then magically\ndissolve it. Your seductive powers will increase tenfold. People will be less upset by your hurtful actions than you might imag-\nine. In the world today, we often feel starved for experience. We crave\nemotion, even if it is negative.

As a result, once you have turned the\npain into pleasure they will readily forgive you. Stir up their jealousy, make\nthem feel insecure, and the validation you later give their ego by preferring\nthem over their rivals is doubly delightful.

She was a\nproud, somewhat difficult woman, and she intimidated Stendhal, who was\nterribly afraid of displeasing her with a stupid comment or undignified act. Finally, unable to take it any longer, he one day took her hand and confessed\nhis love. Horrified, the countess told him to leave and never come back. Stendhal flooded Viscontini with letters, begging her to forgive him. At\nlast, she relented: she would see him again, but under one condition—he\ncould visit only once every two weeks, for no more than an hour, and only\nin the presence of company. Stendhal agreed; he had no choice. He now\nlived for those short fortnightly visits, which became occasions of intense\nanxiety and fear, since he was never quite sure whether she would change\nher mind and banish him forever. This went on for over two years, during\nwhich the countess never showed him the slightest sign of favor.

All he knew was that his\nlove for her only grew stronger, became unbearably intense, until finally he\nhad to leave Milan. To get over this sad affair, Stendhal wrote his famous book On Love, in\nwhich he described the effect of fear on desire. First, if you fear the loved\none, you can never get too close or familiar with him or her. The beloved\nthen retains an element of mystery, which only intensifies your love. Sec-\nond, there is something bracing about fear. It makes you vibrate with sensa-\ntion, heightens your awareness, is intensely erotic. According to Stendhal,\nthe closer the loved one brings you to the edge of the precipice, to the feel-\ning that they could abandon you, the dizzier and more lost you will be-\ncome.

Sabatier was used to\nsuch attentions—one man after another had fallen in love with her—but\nthis letter was different: in this man she seemed to have inspired a quasi-\nreligious ardor. The letter, written in a disguised handwriting, contained a\npoem dedicated to her; titled \"To One Who Is Too Gay,\" it began by prais-\ning her beauty, yet ended with the lines\nAnd so, one night, I'd like to sneak,\nWhen darkness tolls the hour of pleasure,\nA craven thief, toward the treasure\nWhich is your person, plump and sleek. . . . And, most vertiginous delight! Into those lips, so freshly striking\nAnd daily lovelier to my liking—\nInfuse the venom of my spite. Mixed in with her admirer's adoration, clearly, was a strange kind of lust,\nwith a touch of cruelty to it. The poem both intrigued and disturbed\nher—and she had no idea who had written it. A few weeks later another letter arrived. As before, the writer en-\nveloped Sabatier in cultlike worship, mixing the physical and the spiritual.",

Now\nwhen he visited she watched him carefully, and the more she watched, the\nsurer she was that he was the writer, but she never confirmed her intuition,\nbecause she did not want to confront him—he might be shy, but he was a\nman, and at some point he would have to come to her. And she felt certain\nthat he would. Then, suddenly the letters stopped coming—and Madame\nSabatier could not understand why, since the last one had been even more\nadoring than all of the others before. Several years went by, in which she often thought of her anonymous\nadmirer's letters, but they were never renewed. In 1857, however, Baude-\nlaire published a book of poetry, The Flowers of Evil, and Madame Sabatier\nrecognized several of the verses—they were the ones he had written for\nher. Now they were out in the open for everyone to see. A little while later\nthe poet sent her a gift: a specially bound copy of the book, and a letter,\nthis time signed with his name.

Perhaps it was his childlike sincerity, and the fact that he had finally\nwritten to her directly; perhaps it was that he loved her but asked nothing\nof her, unlike all the other men she knew who at some point had always\nturned out to want something.

Raising the Temperature\nIn 1889, the top New York theatrical manager Ernest Jurgens visited\nFrance on one of his many scouting trips. Jurgens was known for his\nhonesty, a rare commodity in the shady entertainment world, and for\nhis ability to find unusual acts. He had to spend the night in Marseilles, and\nwhile wandering along the quay of the old harbor, he heard excited catcalls\nissuing from a working-class cabaret, and decided to go in. A twenty-one-\nyear-old Spanish dancer named Caroline Otero was performing, and the\nminute Jurgens laid eyes on her he was a changed man. Her appearance was\nstartling—five foot ten, fiery dark eyes, black waist-length hair, her body\ncorseted into a perfect hourglass figure. But it was the way she danced that\nmade his heart pound—her whole body alive, writhing like an animal in\nheat, as she performed a fandango.

The Présidente was clearly on edge; she could not look him in the eye. They exchanged pleasantries, but then Valmont turned harsh: she had\ntreated him cruelly, had apparently been determined to make him unhappy. Well, this was the end, they were separating for good, since that was how\nshe wanted it. Tourvel argued back: she was a married woman, she had no\nchoice. Valmont softened his tone and apologized: he was unused to having\nsuch strong feelings, he said, and could not control himself. Still, he would\nnever trouble her again. Then he laid on a table the letters he had come to\nreturn. Tourvel came closer: the sight of her letters, and the memory of all the\nturmoil they represented, affected her powerfully. She had thought his de-\ncision to renounce his libertine way of life was voluntary, she said—with a\ntouch of bitterness in her voice, as if she resented being abandoned. No, it\nwas not voluntary, he replied, it was because she had spurned him. Then\nhe suddenly stepped closer and took her in his arms. She did not resist. \"Adorable woman!\"",

An overt imbalance of power, an overt desire for\npower, will stir envy and resentment; we learn to be kind and polite, at least\non the surface. Even those who have power generally try to act humble and\nmodest—they do not want to offend. In seduction, on the other hand, you\ncan throw all of that out, revel in your dark side, inflict a little pain—in\nsome ways be more yourself. Your naturalness in this respect will prove se-\nductive in itself. The problem is that after years of living in the real world,\nwe lose the ability to be ourselves.

Minutes later he watched her enter\nand undress, and once the candles were extinguished, he crept into bed\nwith her. She protested, tried to scream. He covered her mouth with kisses,\nand she eventually and happily relented. Richelieu had decided to make his\nbold move then for several reasons.

After emotions have reached a pitch,\nthey often swing in the opposite direction—toward\nlassitude, distrust, disappointment. Beware of the long,\ndrawn-out goodbye; insecure, the victim will cling and claw,\nand both sides will suffer. If you are to part, make the sacrifice\nswift and sudden. If necessary, deliberately break the spell you\nhave created. If you are to stay in a relationship, beware a flag-\nging of energy, a creeping familiarity that will spoil the\nfantasy. If the game is to go on, a second seduction is\nrequired. Never let the other person take you for\ngranted—use absence, create pain and con-\nflict, to keep the seduced on ten-\nterhooks. Disenchantment\nSeduction is a kind of spell, an enchantment. When you seduce, you are\nnot quite your normal self; your presence is heightened, you are playing\nmore than one role, you are strategically concealing your tics and insecuri-\nties. You have deliberately created mystery and suspense to make the victim\nexperience a real-life drama. Under your spell, the seduced gets to feel\ntransported away from the world of work and responsibility. You will keep this going for as long as you want or can, heightening the\ntension, stirring the emotions, until the time finally comes to complete the\nseduction. After that, disenchantment almost inevitably sets in.",

You cannot control the other person by nagging and complaining; it will\nmake them defensive, exacerbating the problem. You will have more con-\ntrol if you maintain the proper spirit.

Never try to change your\nvictims; instead, induce them to follow your lead. Avoid the slow burnout. Often, one person becomes disenchanted but\nlacks the courage to make the break.

He left at daybreak more in\nlove than ever, but a few days later they quarreled again. The marquise\nseemed cold after that, and he saw her flirt with another man at a party. He felt horribly jealous, but as before, his solution was to become more\nattentive and loving. This, he thought, was the way to appease a difficult\nwoman.

Interpretation. The Marquise de Merteuil, a character in Choderlos de La-\nclos's novel Dangerous Liaisons, is a practiced seductress who never lets her\naffairs drag on too long. De Belleroche is young and handsome but that is\nall. As her interest in him wanes, she decides to bring him to the secret\nhouse to try to inject some novelty into the affair. This works for a while,\nbut it isn't enough. The chevalier must be gotten rid of. She tries coldness,\nanger (hoping to start a fight), even a show of interest in another man. All\nthis only intensifies his attachment. She can't just leave him—he might be-\ncome vengeful, or try even harder to win her back. The solution: she delib-\nerately breaks the spell by overwhelming him with attention. Abandoning\nthe pattern of alternating warmth with coldness, she acts hopelessly in love.

The lesson is simple: keep the moments after the seduction and the\nseparation in the same key as before, heightened, aesthetic, and pleasant. If\nyou do not act guilty for your feckless behavior, it is hard for the other per-\nson to feel angry or resentful. Seduction is a lighthearted game, in which\nyou invest all of your energy in the moment.

In 1652, the famous French courtesan Ninon de l'Enclos met and fell in\nlove with the Marquis de Villarceaux. Ninon was a libertine; philosophy\nand pleasure were more important to her than love. But the marquis in-\nspired new sensations: he was so bold, so impetuous, that for once in her\nlife she let herself lose a little control. The marquis was possessive, a trait\nshe normally abhorred. But in him it seemed natural, almost charming: he\nsimply could not help himself. And so Ninon accepted his conditions:\nthere were to be no other men in her life. For her part she told him that she\nwould accept no money or gifts from him. This was to be about love, noth-\ning else. She rented a house opposite his in Paris, and they saw each other daily. One afternoon the marquis suddenly burst in and accused her of having\nanother lover. His suspicions were unfounded, his accusations absurd, and\nshe told him so.

Festival Time and Place\nCenturies ago, life in most cultures was filled with work and routine. But at certain moments in the year, this life was interrupted by festi-\nval. During these festivals—saturnalias of ancient Rome, the maypole festi-\nvals of Europe, the great potlatches of the Chinook Indians—work in the\nfields or marketplace stopped. The entire tribe or town gathered in a sacred\nspace set apart for the festival. Temporarily relieved of duty and responsi-\nbility, people were granted license to run amok; they would wear masks or\ncostumes, which gave them other identities, sometimes those of powerful\nfigures reenacting the great myths of their culture. The festival was a\ntremendous release from the burdens of daily life. It altered people's sense\nof time, bringing moments in which they stepped outside of themselves. Time seemed to stand still. Something like this experience can still be\nfound in the world's great surviving carnivals. The festival represented a break in a person's daily life, a radically differ-\nent experience from routine. On a more intimate level, that is how you\nmust envision your seductions.

Around the year 1710, a young man whose father was a prosperous\nwine dealer in Osaka, Japan, found himself daydreaming more and more. He worked night and day for his father, and the burden of family life and\nall of its duties was oppressive. Like every young man, he had heard of the\npleasure districts of the city—the quarters where the normally strict laws of\nthe shogunate could be violated. It was here that you would find the ukiyo,\nthe \"floating world\" of transient pleasures, a place where actors and courte- 436 • Appendix A: Seductive Environment/Seductive Time\nsans ruled. This was what the young man was daydreaming about. Biding\nhis time, he managed to find an evening when he could slip out unnoticed. He headed straight for the pleasure quarters. This was a cluster of buildings—restaurants, exclusive clubs, tea-\nhouses—that stood out from the rest of the city by their magnificence and\ncolor. The moment the young man stepped into it, he knew he was in\na different world. Actors wandered the streets in elaborately dyed kimonos.",

They had such manners and attitudes, as if they were still on stage. The\nstreets bustled with energy; the pace was fast. Bright lanterns stood out\nagainst the night, as did the colorful posters for the nearby kabuki theater. The women had a completely different air about them. They stared at him\nbrazenly, acting with the freedom of a man. He caught sight of an onnagata,\none of the men who played female roles in the theater—a man more beau-\ntiful than most women he had seen and whom the passersby treated like\nroyalty. The young man saw other young men like himself entering a teahouse,\nso he followed them in. Here the highest class of courtesans, the great\ntayus, plied their trade. A few minutes after the young man sat down, he\nheard a noise and bustle, and down the stairs came a few of the tayus, fol-\nlowed by musicians and jesters. The women's eyebrows were shaved, re-\nplaced by a thick black painted line. Their hair was swept up in a perfect\nfold, and he had never seen such beautiful kimonos.

They ignored the young man; he had no\nidea how to invite them over, but he noticed that some of the older men\nhad a way of bantering with them that was a language all its own. The\nwine began to flow, music was played, and finally some lower-level courte-\nsans came in. By then the young man's tongue was loosened. These courtesans\nwere much friendlier and the young man began to lose all track of time. Later he managed to stagger home, and only the next morning did he real-\nize how much money he had spent.

And the elevator would keep groaning\nall night as the beautiful people began to make the place their home.

In 1746, a seventeen-year-old girl named Cristina had come to the city\nof Venice, Italy, with her uncle, a priest, in search of a husband. Cristina\nwas from a small village but had a substantial dowry to offer. The Venetian\nmen who were willing to marry her, however, did not please her. So after\ntwo weeks of futile searching, she and her uncle prepared to return to their\nvillage. They were seated in their gondola, about to leave the city, when\nCristina saw an elegantly dressed young man walking toward them. \"There's a handsome fellow!\" she said to her uncle. \"I wish he was in the\nboat with us.\" The gentleman could not have heard this, yet he approached,\nhanded the gondolier some money, and sat down beside Cristina, much to\nher delight. He introduced himself as Jacques Casanova. When the priest\ncomplimented him on his friendly manners, Casanova replied, \"Perhaps I\nshould not have been so friendly, my reverend father, if I had not been at-\ntracted by the beauty of your niece.\" Cristina told him why they had come to Venice and why they were\nleaving.

Interpretation. After the debacle of 1824, Jackson and his supporters were\ndetermined to do things differently in 1828. America was becoming more\ndiverse, developing populations of immigrants, Westerners, urban laborers,\nand so on. To win a mandate Jackson would have to overcome new re-\ngional and class differences. One of the first and most important steps his\nsupporters took was to found newspapers all around the country. While he\nhimself seemed to have retired from public life, these papers promulgated\nan image of him as the wronged war hero, the victimized man of the peo-\nple. In truth, Jackson was wealthy, as were all of his major backers. He\nowned one of the largest plantations in Tennessee, and he owned many\nslaves. He drank more fine liquor than hard cider and slept on a soft bed\nwith European linens.

But Harry\nnever operated the usual way. He had begun his career as a carnival barker,\nand there the only way to get the public into your tent was to stand out\nfrom the other barkers. So Harry dug up eight scruffy Turks whom he\nfound living in Manhattan, dressed them up in costumes (flowing sea-green\ntrousers, gold-crescented turbans) provided by the movie studio, rehearsed\nthem in every line and gesture, and checked them into an expensive hotel. Word quickly spread to the newspapers (with a little help from Harry) that\na delegation of Turks had arrived in New York on a secret diplomatic\nmission. Reporters converged on the hotel. Since his appearance in New York\nwas clearly no longer a secret, the head of the mission, \"Sheikh Ali Ben\nMohammed,\" invited them up to his suite. The newspapermen were im-\npressed by the Turks' colorful outfits, salaams, and rituals. The sheikh then\nexplained why he had come to New York. A beautiful young woman\nnamed Sari, known as the Virgin of Stamboul, had been betrothed to the\nsheikh's brother. An American soldier passing through had fallen in love\nwith her and had managed to steal her from her home and take her to\nAmerica. Her mother had died from grief. The sheikh had found out she\nwas in New York, and had come to bring her back.",

Mesmerized by the sheikh's colorful language and by the romantic tale\nhe told, the reporters filled the papers with stories of the Virgin of Stam-\nboul for the next several days. The sheikh was filmed in Central Park and\nfeted by the cream of New York society. Finally \"Sari\" was found, and the\npress reported the reunion between the sheikh and the hysterical girl (an\nactress with an exotic look). Soon after, The Virgin of Stamboul opened in\nNew York. Its story was much like the \"real\" events reported in the papers. Was this a coincidence? A quickly made film version of the true story?

(The Capitol, the Rivoli, the\nStrand, and the Rialto were the four big first-run movie houses on Broad-\nway.) Almost everyone saw the ad and wondered what this fabulous show\nwas. The owner of the Capitol asked Harry if he knew anything about it,\nand Harry let him in on the secret: it was all a publicity stunt for an un-\nbooked picture. The owner asked to see a screening of The Forbidden\nWoman; through most of the film, Harry yakked about the publicity cam-\npaign, distracting the man from the dullness onscreen. The theater owner\ndecided to show the film for a week, and so, on the evening of Febru-\nary 21, as a heavy snowstorm blanketed the city and all eyes turned to the\nsky, giant rays of light poured out from the tallest buildings—a brilliant\nshow of green.

The following year Harry was asked to publicize a gangster picture\ncalled Outside the Law. On high-ways across the country he set up billboards\nthat read, in giant letters, IF YOU DANCE ON SUNDAY, YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE\nLAW. On other billboards the word \"dance\" was replaced by \"play golf\" or\n\"play pool\" and so on. On a top corner of the billboards was a shield bear-\ning the initials \"PD.\" The public assumed this meant \"police department\"\n(actually, it stood for Priscilla Dean, the star of the movie) and that the\npolice, backed by religious organizations, were prepared to enforce\ndecades-old blue laws prohibiting \"sinful\" activities on a Sunday. Suddenly\na controversy was sparked. Theater owners, golfing associations, and dance\norganizations led a countercampaign against the blue laws; they put up their\nown billboards, exclaiming that if you did those things on Sunday, you\nwere not \"OUTSIDE THE LAW\" and issuing a call for Americans to have some\nfun in their lives. For weeks the words \"Outside the Law\" were everywhere\nseen and everywhere on people's lips. In the midst of this the film\nopened—on a Sunday—in four New York theaters simultaneously, some-\nthing that had never happened before. And it ran for months throughout\nthe country, also on Sundays. It was one of the big hits of the year. Interpretation.",

Harry Reichenbach, perhaps the greatest press agent in\nmovie history, never forgot the lessons he had learned as a barker. The car-\nnival is full of bright lights, color, noise, and the ebb and flow of the 454 • Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses\ncrowd. Such environments have profound effects on people. A clearheaded\nperson could probably tell that the magic shows are fake, the fierce animals\ntrained, the dangerous stunts relatively safe. But people want to be enter-\ntained; it is one of their greatest needs. Surrounded by color and excite-\nment, they suspend their disbelief for a while and imagine that the magic\nand danger are real. They are fascinated by what seems to be both fake and\nreal at the same time. Harry's publicity stunts merely re-created the carnival\non a larger scale. He pulled people in with the lure of colorful costumes, a\ngreat story, irresistible spectacle. He held their attention with mystery, con-\ntroversy, whatever it took. Catching a kind of fever, as they would at the\ncarnival, they flocked without thinking to the films he publicized. The lines between fiction and reality, news and entertainment are even\nmore blurred today than in Harry Reichenbach's time.",

The media is desperate for events with en-\ntertainment value, inherent drama. Feed that need. The public has a weak-\nness for what seems both realistic and slightly fantastical—for real events\nwith a cinematic edge. Play to that weakness. Stage events the way Bernays\ndid, events the media can pick up as news. But here you are not starting a\nsocial trend, you are after something more short term: to win people's at-\ntention, to create a momentary stir, to lure them into your tent. Make your\nevents and publicity stunts plausible and somewhat realistic, but make their\ncolors a little brighter than usual, the characters larger than life, the drama\nhigher. Provide an edge of sex and danger. You are creating a confluence of\nreal life and fiction—the essence of any seduction. It is not enough, however, to win people's attention: you need to hold\nit long enough to hook them.
